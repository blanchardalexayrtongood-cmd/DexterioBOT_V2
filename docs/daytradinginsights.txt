Day Trading Insights: Comprehensive Summary of 34 Training Videos
Video 1: $5,000,000 with Day Trading at 23
Overview: Tyler (“TJR”) shares his personal journey to earning $5 million by age 23 through day trading. He emphasizes that his success came only after two years of mistakes and lessons, not overnight. Initially, he chased the lifestyle of wealthy traders (cars, watches) instead of focusing on trading fundamentals, which was a huge mistake[1][2]. Starting out, he blew his first account due to no risk management and no strategy, purely thinking “stocks go up” and trying to get rich quick[3][4].
Key Lessons: Tyler’s “blueprint” centers on shifting mindset and building skill:
    • Don’t focus solely on money: The goal of trading isn’t “make quick money” but to master the skill of predicting price movements with high probability – money is a byproduct[5][6]. Early on, Tyler’s obsession with money led to greedy, emotional trades and constant losses. He urges new traders to drop the get-rich-quick mindset.
    • Hard work and discipline: There is no easy shortcut to success. Tyler hit “rock bottom” and realized trading success required consistent hard work, discipline, and doing what others won’t[7]. He read Trading in the Zone by Mark Douglas, which taught him to treat trading seriously and work on his psychology[8]. He also practiced visualization and goal-setting (“law of attraction”), writing down steps and goals to reach his vision[9].
    • Learn from mistakes: Tyler candidly describes early errors: using too much leverage, over-trading, and trading emotionally out of greed and fear. He would cut profits too early and let losses run, all due to lack of confidence in his skill[10]. Only after accepting that trading is a long journey did he start correcting these habits.
    • Extend your timeline: A recurring theme is adjusting expectations – you won’t become a millionaire in weeks. Tyler “expanded his timeline” and committed to trading as a long-term endeavor[11][12]. This mental shift (treating trading like a marathon, not a sprint) was crucial to his turnaround.
Blueprint Steps: By the end, Tyler outlines a step-by-step plan to profitability (the exact steps are detailed in later videos). In summary, Video 1 teaches that success in day trading comes from mastering the basics, managing risk, maintaining discipline, and being patient. Tyler’s story proves that anyone can improve by learning from mistakes and focusing on skill over quick profits[4][7].
Video 2: 6 Years of Trading Knowledge in 20 Minutes
Overview: In this condensed lesson, Tyler compresses six years of hard-earned trading insights into core principles. He explains that consistent profitability comes from balancing three pillars: strategy, risk management, and psychology – with psychology being the most critical. Many traders obsess over finding a “holy grail” strategy, but neglect mindset and risk controls, which is why they fail[13].
Key Insights:
    • Journal and analyze trades: Tyler stresses the importance of journaling every trade and reviewing your performance. By tracking wins and losses, you can identify which setups work and which mistakes you repeat. He credits journaling as a turning point that allowed him to pinpoint patterns (e.g. noticing he won trades when he waited for a certain confluence, and lost when he didn’t)[14][15]. Meticulous record-keeping and reflection enabled him to systematically improve over time.
    • Master risk management: No strategy works if you risk too much or manage trades poorly. Tyler explains that a profitable trader’s first job is to “maximize wins and minimize losses”, which is achieved through a solid risk management plan[16][17]. He suggests setting a daily risk limit (e.g. only risking a small fixed percent of your account per day). If you hit that loss limit, stop trading for the day. He gives an example: if a disciplined trader’s plan allows one losing trade per day, they would stop after that loss, whereas an undisciplined trader without a plan would continue trading out of anger and rack up more losses[18][19]. Sticking to a risk plan prevents emotional decision-making.
    • Psychology over strategy: The video hammers home that psychology is the area most traders struggle with, not technical know-how[20]. Having a robust strategy is important, but executing it consistently under real market stress is even more important. Fear, greed, and impatience cause traders to deviate from even a good strategy. Tyler admits that earlier in his career he would abandon his plan whenever emotions took over, undoing his progress. The remedy is developing discipline and emotional control – essentially training your mind to follow your rules strictly. He says every trader must conquer their own mindset to succeed, placing it even above strategy in importance[13].
    • Stop strategy-hopping: Another insight from Tyler’s 6-year journey is that chasing new strategies constantly will hinder you. Many traders switch strategies after a few losses, endlessly seeking something “better.” Tyler warns you only need one good strategy and the discipline to stick to it[21]. Constantly changing your approach prevents you from mastering any single method. Once you have a sound strategy that fits you, focus on executing it well rather than looking for a magic bullet.
Conclusion: Video 2 distills that long-term success is 20% strategy and 80% psychology/risk management. Tyler encourages traders to reflect on their trades (journal), enforce strict risk limits, and cultivate discipline. With these in place, even a simple strategy can yield great results, whereas without them no strategy will save you[13]. Six years of trial and error taught him that mastering one strategy and one’s own mind is the real key to profitability.
Video 3: 7 Trading Rules That Changed My Life
Overview: Here, Tyler presents seven fundamental trading rules that helped turn him from an inconsistent trader into a consistently profitable one. These rules are not about chart patterns or indicators, but about personal conduct and mindset in trading. He notes that these rules don’t require any special technical knowledge – they address common mistakes and behaviors. By implementing these rules, he overcame errors that plagued his first six months of trading[22][23].
The 7 Rules:
    1. Never trade without a plan. Always have a detailed trading plan and stick to it. Tyler admits he initially created a trading plan (including strategy rules, risk management, psychology rules) but then ignored it whenever greed set in[24][25]. This led to heavy losses. He learned that deviating from your plan – even once – can wipe out days or weeks of profits. This rule is a reminder that a plan is only useful if you actually follow it every single day. Consistency is king. If you don’t have a plan, create one; if you have one, discipline yourself to obey it rigorously (no impulsive trades outside the plan).
    2. Only size up after consistent success – not after one big win. Do not increase your trading size just because of a single profitable day or trade. Tyler tells how he once flipped \$10k into \$112k in a couple days, then immediately tripled his trade size out of excitement – and lost it all the next day[26][27]. The rule is: earn the right to trade bigger by proving you can profit consistently at your current size. For example, if you steadily grew a \$10k account by 10% to \$11k over several weeks, don’t immediately risk based on \$11k. Continue trading as if you have \$10k until you have a long track record, then gradually scale up. Sizing up too fast can trigger emotional trading and large drawdowns, so do it cautiously and only after sustained success.
    3. Stick to one strategy – stop switching constantly. Find a proven strategy that suits you and focus on mastering it rather than trying every new strategy you hear about. Tyler humorously threatens to “punch you through the screen” if you keep switching strategies[21]. This rule exists because he wasted time cycling through multiple strategies, which prevented him from fully learning any of them. By committing to one solid strategy, you gain the depth of experience needed to execute it well. Every time you reset with a new method, you’re back to square one. Remember: An average strategy executed with discipline beats a perfect strategy executed poorly.
    4. Don’t trade if you’re not in the right mental/physical state (“if you feel off, don’t trade”). This rule is about self-awareness. If you are sick, extremely tired, emotionally upset, or distracted, it’s better to sit out. Tyler shares that he’s even placed trades while on an airplane or when feeling unwell – and unsurprisingly, those trades went poorly[28]. Trading requires full focus and emotional balance. If you’re “off your game,” you’re more likely to make mistakes. The markets will be there tomorrow – it’s okay to take a day off rather than force trades in a compromised state.
    5. Avoid FOMO – never chase trades. FOMO (“fear of missing out”) causes traders to jump into a move after it’s already underway, usually leading to losses. Tyler’s rule is do not chase. If you miss an entry according to your plan, let it go – there will be another opportunity[29]. Chasing a trade out of FOMO means you’re no longer trading your strategy; you’re trading your emotions. This often ends with buying the top or selling the bottom. Instead, stick to your planned setups. If the market moves without you, so be it.
    6. Journal your trades. As echoed from Video 2, Tyler insists you “journal your f*cking trades”[30]. Writing down the details of each trade (entry, exit, rationale, outcome, emotions felt) is non-negotiable. Without a journal, you’re “taking shots in the dark” – you won’t know what to improve because you aren’t tracking anything. Tyler credits trade journaling with revealing his recurring mistakes (like entering too early without confirmation) so he could fix them[14][15]. Over time, a journal shows which strategies yield positive expectancy and which habits are hurting you. It is one of the biggest tools for growth.
    7. Live a disciplined life – your lifestyle reflects in your trading. The final rule ties trading success to your overall habits and discipline. Tyler firmly believes “how you treat your life is how you treat your trading”[31]. If you are disorganized, inconsistent, or reckless in daily life, those traits will appear in your trading (e.g. breaking rules, being impulsive). He urges traders to cultivate discipline, consistency, and good habits in everything they do. Treat trading like a business and yourself like a professional. For Tyler, this meant working 7 days a week at trading, avoiding slacking off, and essentially doing a “180” in his lifestyle to become more regimented[32][33]. This rule is about integrity – being disciplined when no one is watching so that when you’re trading, discipline is second nature.
Conclusion: These seven rules became Tyler’s bedrock. By following them, he stopped sabotaging himself and saw dramatic improvement. He reiterates that none of these rules are complex technical tricks – they are about behavior and mindset, the often overlooked side of trading. Traders who implement these rules will likely avoid many common pitfalls. In Tyler’s experience, simplicity and self-discipline trump complicated analysis. Master these core rules and you will “get on the straight and narrow path to profitability”[34].
Video 4: Day Trading for Beginners – The Complete Starter Guide (2025)
Overview: This video is a comprehensive beginner’s guide to day trading. Tyler addresses those starting with small capital (under \$1,000) or trying to pass a funded account challenge. He acknowledges a sad reality: “99% of day traders” blow up their first accounts or fail funding challenges, often by repeating the same mistakes[35]. His goal is to show beginners how to avoid those pitfalls, start with low capital, and build up properly. The guide covers essential concepts: strategy basics, risk management for small accounts, psychology, and leveraging prop firm accounts responsibly.
Key Points:
    • Psychology & risk first, strategy second: Tyler cautions that the biggest reasons new traders lose money aren’t lack of strategy knowledge, but poor psychology and risk management. He explicitly states that while he will teach a strategy in this video, the majority of account blow-ups stem from mindset and risk errors – not the technical strategy[36]. Many beginners chase “pro firm strategies” hoping for a quick win, but if they don’t fix their tendency to overtrade or overleverage, no strategy will save them. Thus, the guide front-loads psychology tips and risk rules before even diving into charts[37][38].
    • The three essential skills: Tyler reiterates the three pillars: an edge (strategy), psychology, and risk management. A trader must develop all three to succeed. He uses a vivid line: “if you only have [strategy], you’re still screwed… you need all three and if you have only two of them, you’re still fucked”[39]. In simple terms, a beginner might learn chart patterns (strategy) and use proper position sizing (risk), but if they panic-sell winners early or revenge-trade after a loss (psychology issues), they will fail. Conversely, a calm disciplined mindset with no strategy also fails. Balance is needed.
    • Strategy for small accounts: For traders with very little capital or those in prop firm challenges, Tyler advocates a simple, high-probability strategy and extra-conservative risk management. With a small account (or a funded account with strict drawdown limits), you can’t afford frequent or large losses. He recommends being “more risk-off than risk-on” – meaning only take the very best setups and skip mediocre trades[40]. Every trade matters much more when your capital is limited. He suggests focusing on higher timeframe trend direction to increase odds (trade with the trend), and keeping trading simple rather than seeking complex “advanced” tricks[41]. In fact, Tyler actively debunks beginners’ desire for something fancy: “the simpler you make it, the easier it’s going to be… a new mega advanced confluence isn’t going to turn you profitable. You’re already struggling with the beginner stuff!”[41][42]. This frank advice encourages sticking to basics like support/resistance, trend, and a couple of confluences (e.g. a price pattern plus a fair value gap) for entries.
    • Risk management for low capital: Tyler outlines risk management differences between a live personal account vs. a prop firm funded account. For a live account under \$1k, you must accept that any single trade risk is just a few dollars (to stay within safe percentages). It feels slow, but it’s critical for survival. For funded accounts, he emphasizes respecting the prop firm’s drawdown rules and treating them like hard stop-losses on your equity[40]. He even gives separate risk plans for each scenario in the video (for example, a max daily loss limit and max trades per day to avoid overtrading funded accounts). The key is to protect your account above all: avoid blowing up so you can stay in the game.
    • Passing funded account challenges: Since many beginners try prop firms to “start with $0”, Tyler addresses how to actually pass those challenges. He warns against jumping in blindly and losing fee after fee. Instead, he suggests first proving yourself on demo, then treat the challenge like real – same risk rules, same strategy. He also mentions having a specific strategy for prop firms (likely the one he demonstrates) and not deviating. The guide acknowledges prop accounts as a viable route if used wisely, but only after one has built skill on simulation. He wants newbies to avoid donating money to prop firms due to impatience.
    • Tools and resources: Tyler introduces essential free tools for beginners. He highlights TradingView for charting, noting that you can start with a free account (paid features aren’t needed at first)[43]. He likely also mentions demo accounts (paper trading) – a free way to practice in real market conditions without risking real money (brokers and TradingView offer these)[44]. He encourages utilizing the abundance of free educational content (like YouTube videos, including his) but warns not to get overwhelmed by conflicting information. The idea is to use reliable resources to learn basics, then focus on a consistent approach.
Conclusion: Video 4 serves as a one-stop primer for starting right in day trading. Tyler’s message to beginners is: focus on learning and execution, not on making money immediately. By avoiding the common traps (under-capitalization, over-leveraging, ignoring psychology), a new trader can actually grow a small account or pass a funding test. He wraps up by showing that once you develop the three skills, even low capital can be leveraged into serious profits, but only if you survive and learn first. This beginner guide builds a foundation that trading is a skill-based profession requiring patience and discipline more than anything else[39][40].
Video 5: Easiest Way to Start Day Trading from Scratch (Exactly What I Did)
Overview: In this video, Tyler shares a step-by-step approach for absolute beginners to start trading from zero, based on how he himself began. He acknowledges the process can be overwhelming, with too many tips and strategies out there[45]. So, he cuts through the noise and outlines the simplest, most practical path to go from knowing nothing to making consistent gains. This includes understanding what trading really is, setting up the basics, and building skill before capital.
Key Topics:
    • What is day trading, really? Tyler starts by breaking down what trading is in simple terms, using an old-school analogy. He describes the fundamental concept: buy low, sell high, and explains how in the past one had to call a broker to buy shares and get paper certificates[46][47]. Nowadays it’s all digital and instantaneous, but the core idea remains – you are trying to buy something and later sell it for more (or vice versa for short selling). Crucially, he emphasizes that trading as a profession is not just “making money” but predicting price movements with high probability[48][49]. This reframing is important for beginners: don’t think of trading as a ATM or casino; see it as a skill of forecasting market direction. Money comes as a side effect of accurate predictions, not from sheer will to make cash. Tyler warns that focusing only on money is the “first and biggest mistake” newbies make[48], because it leads to emotional trading. Instead, focus on the process and analysis – the “nerdy” work of figuring out where price is likely to go next[49].
    • Mindset for beginners: Continuing the above point, Tyler drills in that day trading is not for the lazy or faint-hearted. Beginners often come lured by lifestyle and think they’ll get rich quick. He flatly tells them: if you’re not willing to work hard and be disciplined, trading isn’t for you[50][51]. He even jokes that those unwilling to drop the get-rich-quick mentality might as well fill out a McDonald’s job application[52]. The right mindset to start with is accepting that you will suck at first, losses are part of the learning, and it might take years to become consistently profitable. This honest wake-up call is meant to filter out unrealistic expectations. Tyler wants newbies to commit to learning the craft, treating it like learning any high-level skill.
    • Step 1: Secure an income & time to trade. If you have $0 or very little money, your first step isn’t actually trading – it’s earning some income to live and eventually fund a trading account[53][54]. Tyler suggests finding a flexible job or side hustle that allows you time to trade or practice. In his case, he did DoorDash/UberEats deliveries because he could set his own schedule and pause during market hours to focus on trading[55]. He acknowledges many work 9-to-5 or attend school, which might conflict with New York market open. If so, he advises sacrificing some comfort (like sleep) to trade an alternative session (for example, he traded London session at night while in college)[56]. The main idea: don’t quit your job to trade if you have no savings. Keep a reliable income, and fit trading around it, even if it means odd hours or extra effort. This ensures your bills are paid and you’re not putting financial pressure on your trading from day one.
    • Step 2: Learn and practice for free (education + demo trading). Tyler then emphasizes using free resources and tools to build your trading skill before risking real money. He points beginners to free content (like his YouTube, other reputable trading channels, free courses) to learn basics like technical analysis, market structure, etc. He also introduces paper trading (demo accounts) as a safe sandbox[44]. “Demo trading is by far one of the most beneficial tools and it’s free”, he says, because it lets you practice in real market conditions without losing money[44][57]. He actually recommends treating demo seriously until you can be profitable there for a few months. By doing so, you prove to yourself that your strategy works and you have discipline – before the added stress of real money. Tyler notes that many skip this step, but they shouldn’t: if you can’t make money on demo, you won’t make it live. Use the simulator to sharpen your strategy and execution skills with zero risk. During this phase, also familiarize yourself with the trading platform, charting on TradingView, and journaling trades. Essentially, this is your training period. He himself spent considerable time trading fake money and journaling results until he was confident.
    • Step 3: Gradually move to real trading (small stakes or prop firm). After proving profitable on demo and saving up some money (or a prop firm fee), Tyler guides how to start live trading in a smart way. If you have a bit of savings, you can open a small account (he started with a few thousand dollars) – but only trade micro lots/shares initially. If you truly have \$0, he discusses leveraging prop firm challenges (funding companies) where, for a fee, you can attempt to trade a larger account and keep a share of profits. Tyler is careful to explain that even with prop firms, you need skill and discipline first. Many beginners burn through multiple challenge fees without preparation. Instead, he suggests: once you’re confident in demo, take a prop firm challenge as if it were real, with strict risk rules, and treat the fee as an investment in your trading business. He even mentions some one-step evaluation prop firms that have relatively low barriers (for example, some \$100 fee for a chance at a \$10k-$20k account)[58][59]. The point is, with skill, you can start trading others’ capital without needing a lot of your own – but if you rush in unprepared, you’ll just fail those challenges. Tyler’s own journey to real trading involved small size and scaling up slowly. He never bet an amount that could devastate him. Beginners should do the same: trade tiny until you see consistency, then gradually increase risk.
    • Step 4: Use the right tools (charts, broker) and keep learning. Tyler ensures newbies set themselves up with basic tools: a decent charting platform (again, TradingView free is fine)[43], a reliable broker (for demo and later live trading), and perhaps a community or mentorship (he often references his free course/bootcamp for structured learning). He reiterates not to over-spend on fancy software or indicator packages upfront – your success won’t come from a magic indicator, but from understanding market fundamentals and managing yourself. As you go live, continue journaling every trade and studying your journal to refine your edge. Treat the first year or two as tuition in the market.
Conclusion: Video 5 essentially outlines “Tyler’s roadmap” for a beginner with nothing: learn the basics ? practice extensively on demo ? secure some capital or funded account ? go live cautiously ? scale up over time. He reflects that this exact approach took him from a struggling beginner (even having -\$2,000 in his bank at one point) to a six-figure trader[60][61]. The overarching theme is to value skill development over rushing to make money. By following these steps, a beginner builds a solid foundation and increases their chances of long-term success, rather than becoming another statistic of those who blew up early on.
(Tyler even gives a bit of economic history/current events during this guide – e.g., he reads news of a government shutdown ending while live-trading in one segment[62] – underscoring that part of learning is staying informed about market-moving news.)
Video 6: Fair Value Gaps Explained
Overview: This video is a focused technical lesson on Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) – also known as imbalances in price. Tyler calls it “the only fair value gap video you need” because he thoroughly covers how to identify FVGs, why they occur, and how to trade using them[63]. FVGs are a key part of his trading strategy (one of the “confluences” he often mentions), so he wants viewers to deeply understand this concept.
Key Concepts:
    • What is a Fair Value Gap (imbalance)? Tyler explains that a fair value gap is essentially a three-candlestick pattern where one candle makes a strong move, leaving a “gap” between itself and the candles before/after[64][65]. In practical terms, it’s an area on a chart where price moved so fast in one direction that the opposing orders didn’t get a chance to fill, creating an imbalance between buy and sell orders. For example, in a bullish FVG: imagine three candles where the middle candle is a large bullish candle. The low of that bullish candle is above the high of the prior candle, and its high is above the next candle’s low – this creates a gap in between (no overlap)[64][66]. Tyler illustrates this with a drawing: Candle 1 (small), Candle 2 (big up move), Candle 3. The “fair value gap” is the empty space between Candle 1’s high and Candle 3’s low. In that gap, he says, there’s a lack of sell orders (in a bullish gap) or lack of buy orders (in a bearish gap) because price moved too fast[66][67].
    • Why FVGs matter (the logic): Because these gaps indicate an imbalance, Tyler notes that price often retraces to “fill” the gap later as the market seeks equilibrium[68]. In a bullish FVG, that means price might drop back into the gap zone where those missing sell orders were, and if buyers step in there (filling those orders), price will likely bounce and continue up. This happens because markets naturally gravitate toward areas of liquidity – an FVG is like unfinished business. He explains it like this: if there’s a gap with no sell orders, eventually sellers will push price down into it to “balance out” the price action, then buyers can take over again[67]. Traders use this behavior by waiting for price to retrace into an FVG, then enter in the original trend direction (e.g., buy at a bullish FVG fill in an uptrend, sell at a bearish FVG in a downtrend). Tyler emphasizes context – FVGs work best when aligned with the higher timeframe trend. A bullish FVG in an uptrend is likely to act as support, whereas one against the trend might not hold.
    • How to identify FVGs: Tyler provides a clear identification rule: look for a three-candle sequence where Candle 3 does not overlap Candle 1. Mark the gap area between Candle 1’s wick and Candle 3’s wick[64][69]. He notes color of candles doesn’t matter for the first and third candle – what matters is the large displacement by the middle candle[70]. He demonstrates marking out multiple examples on a chart. Also, he distinguishes bullish vs. bearish FVGs: A bullish FVG (imbalance left by a fast up-move) is an area lacking sell orders, and a bearish FVG (from a fast drop) is lacking buy orders[71].
    • Trading with FVGs: Tyler shows that he uses FVGs daily as a confluence to enter trades[72]. His general approach: identify a valid FVG in line with his bias, wait for price to retrace into that gap, then look for a confirmation (like a smaller timeframe reversal) to enter. He stresses not to trade an FVG blindly without considering trend and other confluences. But combined with a break of structure or SMT divergence, for example, an FVG fill is one of his favorite entry triggers. In his words, it’s a “super great confluence I use every single day”[72]. He also cautions not every FVG gets filled – some remain partially open if the market continues strongly in one direction[73]. So one must still manage risk and not assume a fill will always happen immediately. Typically, higher timeframe imbalances are more significant.
    • Inverse FVGs: Tyler briefly mentions inverse fair value gaps. This is a bit more advanced – it seems to refer to situations like gaps on lower timeframes that appear as single candle wicks on higher timeframes, etc., or perhaps a concept ICT traders use. He doesn’t dwell too much on it in the summary, but likely covers it in detail in the video. The main takeaway is understanding standard FVGs first.
Conclusion: By the end of Video 6, a viewer should be able to spot fair value gaps on their charts and know why they matter. Tyler effectively shows that FVGs are a window into market order flow – they reveal where one side of the market was overpowered. By waiting for those gaps to be filled, traders can potentially join the dominant trend at a better price. Tyler’s teaching style in this video is methodical: define, explain the cause, then demonstrate identification and usage. This builds a strong intuition for a concept that he uses alongside others (like order blocks, break of structure) in building his trade setups.
Citing an example from the video: Tyler demonstrates a bullish fair value gap and says, “there’s a lack of sell orders within this gap… if price retraces into it and we see buy orders fill that area, price is likely to proceed up, especially if we’re in an uptrend”[66][67]. This encapsulates the power of FVGs in trading.
Video 7: How I Made $427,390 in One Day Trading FOMC!
Overview: In this video, Tyler recounts an extremely profitable trading day – making over \$427k in a single session – which occurred on an FOMC (Federal Reserve meeting) day. This is an extraordinary result, even for him, and serves to illustrate what’s possible with skill, preparation, and a bit of luck on high volatility news days. The video is part trade recap and part motivational showcase. Tyler likely breaks down which trades he took around the FOMC announcement and how he managed to capitalize on the volatility.
Highlights and Lessons:
    • Setup to the big trade: Tyler explains the context of the day. On Fed announcement days (FOMC days), markets often have explosive moves. He had a game plan going in, probably identifying key levels that might be hit if the Fed outcome was X or Y. While the video doesn’t detail every entry (he mentions he wasn’t able to record live during the trades)[74], he does show screen recordings of his entries/exits and a verified PnL for transparency[74]. We can infer he either took a heavy position or series of trades during the volatility spike. Possibly, he waited for the initial knee-jerk reaction and then caught the real directional move.
    • Full porting and conviction: The magnitude of profit suggests Tyler “full-ported” (went all-in with his account capital or very large size) on at least one trade that day. Indeed, later videos explicitly mention him full-porting on FOMC (e.g., Video 23). This indicates extremely high conviction. It’s important to note he did this after years of experience and only in situations he deems asymmetric. For a beginner, this is not advised (it’s gambling). But Tyler wanted to demonstrate that when skill, confidence, and conditions align, he isn’t afraid to bet big. The lesson might be about “going for it” when you have an edge, but only if you truly understand the risks. He likely also stresses this is not everyday trading – it was a special situation and he managed risk tightly (perhaps using profits made earlier as cushion).
    • Trade analysis: Without specific quotes, we surmise Tyler goes through the chart of that day showing where he entered and why. For example, he might say he noticed the market’s first move was a fake-out, and he then loaded into the opposite direction once he got confirmation of a reversal, riding a huge trend. Or he anticipated a certain level being run and positioned accordingly. He shows the importance of preparation on news days: having key levels marked (like previous highs/lows, imbalance zones) and a plan for different scenarios. So when volatility hit, he wasn’t reacting emotionally; he executed a pre-planned strategy.
    • Emotional control: Making nearly half a million in a day can mess with one’s psyche. Tyler often preaches staying even-keeled. By sharing this achievement, he might also discuss how after big wins, you must remain disciplined. Some traders might get overconfident or reckless following such a win. Tyler’s likely advice is to stick to normal risk rules the next day and not let ego take over. Similarly, the video is inspirational – showing that through consistency, one day you might hit a home run, but you shouldn’t expect every day to be like that.
    • Transparency and inspiration: Tyler shows his PnL and mentions posting it to Instagram, etc. The reason is to inspire his followers and also validate that what he’s teaching can yield real results. Seeing \$427k in one day is eye-popping, and it’s a testament to how far he’s come (recall, he started with small accounts and blew up many times). He often says if he can do it, others can, but only with the right work ethic and adherence to the principles he’s been teaching. So, this video serves as both a breakdown of a stellar trade and motivational content.
Conclusion: Video 7 is a case study in hitting a massive trade. The key takeaways for viewers are that big news events can create huge opportunities if you are prepared and skilled, and that on such days the moves can be life-changing. However, Tyler likely tempers the excitement with caution: one big day doesn’t make you infallible, so continue following your plan moving forward. It’s a celebratory video in tone – showing the reward for all the discipline and strategy discussed in prior videos. As he says at the start, “this is how I made \$427,000 day trading FOMC today...”[74] – a line that certainly grabs attention and shows what’s possible at the high end of trading performance.
Video 8: How I Reprogrammed My Mind to Make \$5,000 Every Day
Overview: This video dives into trader psychology and mindset shifts, detailing how Tyler changed his mental programming to achieve consistent profits (aiming for \$5k daily). He shares that in the past he would “blow accounts like it was [his] full-time job” due to over-leveraging, over-trading, and overthinking[75]. The turning point was not a new strategy, but a mindset overhaul[76]. Tyler essentially teaches how to rewire your subconscious beliefs and habits so that making money daily becomes feasible.
Key Themes:
    • The wrong mindset = repeated mistakes: Tyler recounts that as an unprofitable trader, he knew what he was doing wrong (e.g. “I can’t stick to my strategy, I can’t stick to my risk plan”), yet he kept doing it[77][78]. Why? Because his subconscious programming was geared toward instant gratification, greed, and fear. He says many traders are in this boat – “you know the mistakes holding you back, but you keep repeating them”. This is because deeply, you haven’t changed the way you think. If you secretly still want to “get rich quick” or believe you can’t succeed, you’ll sabotage yourself. His message: to change your results, you must change your subconscious thoughts first[79][80].
    • Expanding your time horizon: The first mental shift Tyler emphasizes is letting go of short-term expectations. He literally tells viewers if they think a quick trick will make them instantly profitable, “just click off the video… trading is not for you”[81]. Instead, accept it might take a year or two (or more) of persistent effort to become consistently profitable[82]. Tyler realized that pressuring himself to get rich in weeks was causing over-trading and emotional decisions. Once he extended his timeline – telling himself it’s okay if it takes a couple of years – he relaxed, learned from each trade, and stopped forcing things[83][84]. Ironically, by not trying to “get rich by tomorrow,” he started on the path to get rich eventually. He reminds that a year or two of sacrifice is a small price for a lifetime of financial freedom[85].
    • Treat trading like a business (and yourself like a CEO): The second big change was professionalizing his approach. Tyler began to act as if he were already a successful trader – essentially manifestation through behavior. He mentions the power of “acting like the person you want to become”[86][87]. For him, that meant: following his plan to the letter, keeping a routine, being disciplined and consistent every day – because that’s what successful traders do. He even used techniques like affirmations and visualization: daily telling himself “I am a profitable trader. I stick to my strategy and risk management” while taking cold showers, and writing these statements in a notebook[88][89]. By feeding his subconscious with these positive statements and mental imagery of success, he gradually eliminated the negative self-doubt talk (“I can’t pass a funded account”, “I suck at this”)[90]. This is essentially rewiring the brain. Tyler shows pages of his old notebook with lines like “I will be a millionaire. I will own a Lamborghini. I will take good trades. I will be patient…” – which he wrote and repeated daily[89]. Over time, his actions aligned with these beliefs, leading to consistent \$5k days.
    • Discipline and habits: Tyler declares discipline as the critical skill to build, calling it one of the hardest because we all have bad habits[91]. He insists you must break bad habits (both in trading and life) and replace them with good ones. For example, if you have a habit of checking social media between trades and it distracts you into missing setups, instill a new habit to avoid that during trading hours. He draws a parallel: if you can’t control aspects of your personal life (diet, sleep schedule, etc.), it will be hard to be laser-focused and disciplined in trading[92]. So he cleaned up his lifestyle, treating his day like that of a top athlete or executive. Tyler mentions he works on trading literally 365 days a year, totally immersing in it, because “when you’re your own boss, every single thing matters”[93]. The takeaway is that a disciplined life yields disciplined trading.
    • Concrete techniques to reprogram the mind: Besides affirmations, Tyler suggests visualization (imagine in detail your future successful self and work backwards to figure what steps that “future you” took)[94]. He also touches on manifestation – not in a mystical way, but as a psychological priming. By believing and repeatedly stating your goals (“I make X per month trading”), you align your subconscious to find ways to make it true[95][96]. The key is coupling this mental work with consistent action (discipline). Another tactic he used was writing down goals and rules daily, which reinforces them in your mind. All these practices – cold showers with self-talk, journaling goals, acting as if, strict daily routine – contributed to Tyler essentially becoming the kind of trader who can pull \$5k each day.
Conclusion: Video 8 is an eye-opener that the biggest obstacle in trading is often you. Tyler shows that by reprogramming his mindset from one of impatience, greed, and inconsistency to one of patience, confidence, and discipline, he unlocked consistent profitability[76]. The transformation was not about finding a new indicator or strategy – he says outright his strategy stayed the same, but his thinking changed[76]. For viewers, the lesson is inspiring: change your mind, change your trading. Tyler effectively provides a blueprint for mental conditioning: widen your time horizon, emulate successful traders’ habits now, break your bad habits through discipline, and use affirmations/visualizations to reinforce positive change. By doing so, you create the mindset needed to execute your trading plan flawlessly day in and day out, which is what leads to making money every day. In sum, consistency in profits comes from consistency in mindset and habits. Tyler’s own story of turning his life around and then regularly making \$5k+ a day stands as proof of the power of psychological reprogramming.
Video 9: How to Find Daily Bias (Step by Step)
Overview: Here Tyler teaches a step-by-step process to determine the market’s “daily bias” – i.e., whether to be bullish or bearish for the day. Many traders wake up unsure of market direction; this video solves that by outlining exactly how Tyler figures out where price is likely to go each day[97]. He demonstrates using recent charts (live market examples), so viewers can follow along and learn to do it themselves.
The Daily Bias Framework: Tyler’s method revolves around analyzing the previous trading session’s price action to inform the current session’s bias. He notes that price typically follows one of a few patterns from one session to the next[98][99]. He identifies three main scenarios (daily profiles) that can occur:
    1. Previous Session Consolidation ? New Session Manipulation & Reversal. In this scenario, the prior session was largely sideways (no big trend or “manipulation” move). When the new session (e.g., New York open) begins, price might fake out in one direction (manipulation) then reverse and make its true move. Tyler calls this a “previous session consolidation, new session manipulation + reversal” profile[100][101]. For example, if London session was flat, then at New York open, price might spike up quickly (manipulating breakout traders) and then sharply reverse into a decline – that decline would be the main move of the day. If you identified consolidation overnight, you’d expect a fake move then reversal during your trading session.
    2. Previous Session Manipulation ? New Session Reversal. In this profile, the previous session did have a stop-run or manipulation move (e.g., London pushed price above a key high or below a key low then reversed within London). However, it didn’t fully follow through to a big trend – so the expectation is that the new session will continue the unfinished business. Essentially, if London manipulated and partially reversed, New York might carry on further in that reversal direction[101][102]. Tyler describes it as London did a manipulation but didn’t get the big reversal, so New York will produce the reversal move. For instance, London session runs stops above a high then stalls; New York session is expected to drop (complete the bearish move).
    3. Previous Session Manipulation & Reversal ? New Session Continuation. In this case, the prior session already had a clear manipulation and subsequent trend move (reversal). The idea is the new session will continue in the same direction as that established trend[103]. Tyler says this often happened just the day before in his example[104] – one session (say London) manipulated a low, reversed up, and New York then continued that bullish trend further. So if you see that the previous session already made a significant reversal off a manipulation, your daily bias for the current session would align with that existing trend (continuation).
Tyler explains these are basically the only three ways price can behave from one session to the next[105][106]. He simplifies it: either the previous session was quiet (so expect a fake + reversal in the new), or it faked and didn’t go (so new will go), or it faked and went (so new will keep going).
    • Using SMT and session highs/lows: To implement this, Tyler looks at session highs and lows and SMT (Smart Money Technique) divergences between indices (he often trades S&P 500 (ES) and NASDAQ). For example, he’ll check: did London session take out a significant high or low? Is NASDAQ making a higher high while ES made a lower high (a bearish SMT) or vice versa?[107][108] These clues tell him if a “manipulation” happened. In the video, he notes an example where during London, NASDAQ swept a high while S&P did not – indicating a likely bearish setup (one index leading, one lagging) for New York[109][110].
    • Step-by-step procedure: Tyler outlines how he maps the previous session: mark London high/low, mark Asian session high/low, see where current price is relative to those. Then identify if any of those were swept. Next, decide which of the 3 scenarios we are in. For instance, “London took out a low and reversed higher, so my bias for New York is bullish continuation – I will look for longs”. Or “London did nothing (consolidation), so I’ll watch for a manipulation after NY open – maybe a quick stop run up then I’ll look to short the reversal”. He actually draws these scenarios out for clarity[100][103], calling them daily profiles.
    • Example from video: He walks through a live day: He notes coming into New York open, perhaps London was flat. Immediately at NY open, say the market “dumps” (goes down hard) – he might suspect that’s the manipulation (stop run to the downside), and anticipate a reversal upward. If confirmation comes (price springs back up breaking structure), he’ll bias long for the rest of the day to target the opposite session highs. He shows a case of such manipulation-reversal where New York took the market all the way to London’s high[111][112].
    • Why this matters: Having a daily bias means you spend the day mostly looking for trades in one direction (long or short), which improves focus and results. Tyler mentions many traders are lost at the charts each morning; his method gives a systematic way to “read the story” of liquidity from prior sessions so you’re not guessing. It doesn’t mean the bias is always 100% right, but it gives a probabilistic edge. And if conditions change, you can reassess.
Conclusion: Video 9 provides a powerful routine for day traders: analyze the prior session’s behavior (consolidation or manipulation), use it to set a directional bias for the current session, and know what kind of price moves to expect. Tyler essentially teaches how to anticipate the market’s next move by understanding liquidity flows across sessions. By applying this, traders can avoid being on the wrong side. It’s a step-by-step approach, as he promised, and following it can remove a lot of uncertainty. As he sums up, “there are literally only three ways the last session could move… it really is that simple”[105][106]. This demystifies daily bias and equips traders with a plan each day.
Video 10: How to Start Day Trading with \$0
Overview: In this video, Tyler addresses those who want to begin trading but have essentially no money to start with. He lays out exactly what he would do if he had to start over from \$0, based on his own experience of trading while broke. The video covers: finding ways to get trading capital, what jobs or side hustles pair well with learning trading, and how to transition from no money to trading a funded account or a small account.
Key Points:
    • Reality check – you need some money to trade: Tyler begins by reinforcing that while you can start learning with \$0, you will eventually need some capital to trade or at least a small amount to attempt a funded account[53]. Trading is not like freelancing where you earn with no investment – you either need money to trade or to pay for evaluations to get investor capital. So the first focus is making money outside trading to support yourself and build a stake[113].
    • Choose a flexible income source: Tyler highly recommends jobs that allow flexibility to practice trading. He personally did DoorDash/Uber Eats delivery because he could schedule around market hours[55]. For many, a regular 9-5 will overlap the New York session, which is prime trading time. His advice: if you have a 9-5 (or college classes) that conflict, consider trading a different session (like he traded London from the US, sacrificing sleep)[114]. Or find a side gig on off-hours. The sacrifice is temporary – the goal is to free yourself with trading income eventually. Tyler empathizes that it’s tough (he recounts trading at night and being exhausted) but “those sleepless nights…eventually pay off”[115]. This underscores the commitment needed. He even says if you currently have no job and bills to pay, get a quick-paying job now (even if it’s not glamorous) rather than trying another slow-to-monetize hustle like dropshipping[116]. Urgent bills require urgent income, trading will come later.
    • Assemble free resources and tools: Similar to Video 5, Tyler lists the free tools you should use when starting with \$0. These include:
    • A free TradingView account for charting[43],
    • a demo account for practicing trades (since you have no money to go live),
    • and plenty of free educational content (like YouTube videos such as these, free PDFs, forums, etc.). He explicitly says you don’t need to spend on expensive courses or software at the start[43] – leverage all the free stuff first. For example, TradingView’s free plan allows one to chart and even paper trade with virtual money. Most brokers provide free demo accounts as well. Use these to your advantage until you have proven consistency.
    • Learning while broke: Tyler outlines a schedule: spend time each day learning (studying trading concepts, watching videos), and also spend time practicing on the charts (replay mode, paper trading) – all for free. All the while, keep the job income flowing. He suggests that after work hours or during flexible job time, devote at least a few hours daily to trading education/practice, essentially treating it like an unpaid internship. This builds skill without financial pressure.
    • Slowly fund your trading journey: Once you have saved a bit from your job or side hustle, you have a couple options:
    • Open a small live account: Even \$100–\$500 can be used with a broker that offers micro lots. Tyler warns not to expect huge money from this – the point is to get used to real-money execution and emotions, but still keep risk tiny. Losing \$50 on a \$500 account is a 10% hit, which is significant, so you must be careful.
    • Attempt a prop firm challenge: Many proprietary trading firms allow you to pay a fee (say \$100–\$200) to attempt to trade a demo and if you meet targets without breaking rules, they fund you (e.g., give \$10k–\$50k account to trade). Tyler actually encourages this route once you have proven profitable on a demo and maybe with a small account, because it can leverage your small savings into a larger capital. In the video he mentions his strategy and companies he used starting out[117][58]. He likely cites one-step evaluation firms or ones with retry options to maximize chances.
    • Leverage free trials and contests: Some firms or brokers have free demo contests where winners get real money or free challenges. With \$0, one could also try entering those to win funding. Tyler might hint at exploring such opportunities if they exist.
    • Keep expenses low & reinvest: Tyler likely advises to live frugally while pursuing trading. Any money you save or earn, allocate some to trading education or capital. Don’t immediately upgrade your lifestyle after a few wins; instead, reinvest in your trading (better equipment, more capital) until it’s reliably producing income. This was probably his approach – even after he started making money, he didn’t splurge until he grew his accounts substantially.
Conclusion: Video 10 is a practical game plan for starting from nothing. Tyler’s story of having negative $2,000 in his bank account and then doing side gigs to climb out and fund his trading is proof it can be done[60][118]. The overarching advice is: stabilize your income first, learn and practice trading for free, then gradually step into real trading when ready. He removes any excuses by outlining the easiest, cheapest way to start – but doesn’t sugarcoat the effort required. If you truly have zero funds, your currency is time and effort. Use those to build skill until money is less of an issue. Tyler’s plan is empowering: even if you’re broke, you can work, learn, and grow – and in a year or two, potentially transition to a full-time trader. Just remember, as he quips, “if you have literally no bread to your name… you need to start making money (outside trading) because eventually you’ll need money to make money in the markets”[119][113]. In other words, hustle now, trade later.
Video 11: How to Start Day Trading as a Beginner in 2025 (9+ hours)
Overview: This marathon 9-hour video is effectively Tyler’s free complete trading course, consolidating all his teachings and strategies in one place for 2025 beginners. It’s intended to be an A-to-Z guide: covering mindset, risk management, strategy (with all confluences), and putting it together into a trading plan[120][121]. The video revisits many concepts from earlier videos but in a structured, long-form format. Tyler explicitly says this is a “full compiled thoughts” tutorial so that a newbie can watch it start to finish and not need to scour the internet further[120].
Key Components:
    • Mindset Reset: Tyler starts by adjusting the viewer’s headspace before diving into technical content[122][123]. He echoes earlier messages: trading is not a get-rich-quick scheme, you will suck at first, and that’s normal. He emphasizes having the right expectations – that this video/course won’t instantly make you profitable tomorrow, but it will put you on the “right path towards profitability” if you absorb and practice it[124][125]. Tyler also confronts the flashy guru marketing out there (5-minute strategies, etc.), calling it BS. He wants viewers to commit mentally to learning properly rather than chasing gimmicks[123][125].
    • The goal of trading: He defines the goal not as making money, but as accurately predicting price direction with high probability on a daily basis[6]. Money is the side effect of doing that well. By framing it this way, he shifts beginners away from PnL focus to process focus (a recurring theme). This is likely followed by a quick recap of the statistic that most traders fail and give up, often because they don’t have a solid comprehensive education (which he’s about to provide)[126][127].
    • Three pillars emphasized: As expected, Tyler reinforces the importance of psychology, risk management, and strategy – “you need all three skills maxed out to become a profitable trader”[39]. He mentions most newbies put 90% of their effort on learning strategy and almost none on psych/risk, which is backwards[128][13]. In this course, he dedicates sections to each pillar. For example, he spends extensive time on mindset (perhaps including live exercises or deeper discussions on discipline, similar to Video 8 content). He also thoroughly covers risk management planning (likely walking through setting a daily loss limit, position sizing techniques, etc.), and then strategy.
    • Strategy – full breakdown of his trading system: The strategy section is likely the longest. Tyler said he compiled “hours worth of content” into this, and indeed references earlier that he already made a 5-hour strategy video, which this draws upon[129]. He teaches all the confluences he uses: market structure (higher highs/lows), liquidity (draws on liquidity, session highs/lows), fair value gaps, order blocks, breaker blocks, SMT divergence, equilibrium levels, etc. Essentially, he unloads the entire toolkit. He mentioned if he tried to teach every confluence in detail, it’d be 5 hours – which he did elsewhere – so here he may refer to that or compress key points. For instance, he might demonstrate how to mark a bias (like Video 9’s method), then how to confirm an entry (e.g. need a liquidity sweep + break of structure + FVG retest), etc., giving a step-by-step trade example. The idea is to present one cohesive strategy built from these pieces so the viewer can replicate it.
    • Risk management segment: Tyler gives concrete rules for risk per trade, risk per day, and how to handle losing streaks. He likely explains the concept of risk/reward and win rate – how you can be profitable with 40% win rate if R:R is 1:3, for example. He teaches to think in probabilities, not attach to individual trades. Also managing funded account vs personal account differences might be touched on, as he did in Video 4. Expect specific advice like: “Never risk more than 1-2% of your account on a single trade. Limit yourself to maybe 3 trades a day maximum. If you hit X loss, stop for the day.” etc., which he’s hinted before[18][130].
    • Live examples and practice: Given the length, he likely includes live chart examples, trade recaps, and maybe even quiz-like interactions. He might replay a day’s price action and narrate how to apply the taught strategy in real-time. This helps solidify the concepts for viewers.
    • Putting it all together: Toward the end, Tyler probably shows how to create a trading plan incorporating all aspects: E.g., “My plan: Each morning, determine bias (like this…), then look for XYZ setup, manage risk like so, journal the trades, repeat.” He essentially equips the beginner with a template for how to operate like him. It’s a “free course” that could rival paid ones, as he intended[131][121]. He even refers to it as a “free guide to becoming a profitable day trader in 2025”[132].
Conclusion: Video 11 is the culmination of Tyler’s educational content, meant to take someone from knowing nothing to having a concrete trading approach and the right mindset. It’s extremely comprehensive – touching everything from basic definitions (he even explains what day trading is and common terms) to advanced strategies. The main advantage of this video is structure and depth; earlier videos hit on individual topics, but here it’s a structured course. If the viewer follows through (and Tyler acknowledges only a dedicated minority will watch a 9-hour video to the end), they will have a strong foundation. Tyler essentially says, “this is your free course – everything you need is here; if you watch and apply it start to finish, you won’t have to waste time with random info or scammers”[127][133].
In essence, the video underlines that success in trading requires learning a lot and practicing – there’s no shortcut. It’s why he made it so long. He notes most people won’t even finish it, which separates serious learners from the rest[134]. Those who do are already demonstrating the patience and dedication required to be part of the 1% who succeed. Tyler’s final send-off likely encourages viewers to stay disciplined, keep the long game in mind, and welcomes them into the next level of their trading journey.
(One notable quote from this video’s intro: “Day trading is a skill just like anything else – you’re going to suck at it at first… but that’s okay as long as we learn from mistakes and never make them again”[135]. This encapsulates the spirit of the entire 9-hour guide.)
Video 12: Live Day Trading Losing \$12,781 (I GOT FKED)
Overview: In this live trading vlog, Tyler shows an example of a losing day, where he ended down about \$12.8k and felt he “got f***ed” by the market. It’s an honest recap highlighting a specific trading error he made and the lessons from it. These live loss videos serve to prove that even successful traders have red days and, importantly, to analyze what went wrong so as to avoid repeating it.
Scenario Description: Tyler explains that on this particular day, he was trading NASDAQ (and possibly S&P 500) and had a short bias. His analysis going in: he wanted the market to go down after grabbing some highs. In his words, “I high-key wanted us to sweep out London session highs… and then get a rotation down” to an hourly order block level[136][137]. Indeed, he anticipated a short trade: both NASDAQ and ES had setup a possible bearish scenario (ES had already taken some highs, NASDAQ not yet, forming an SMT divergence). He had multiple confluences lining up for a short – five-minute order block, breaker, fair value gap, etc. – and he took a short position.
    • What went right initially: The trade actually started to work. The market did move down as he predicted, reaching his first target. Tyler mentions his first take-profit was at an hourly order block and equilibrium level, which was hit[138]. At that point, he moved his stop to breakeven on another ES trade, and on NASDAQ he had unrealized profit. Had he closed everything there, it would have been a nice win.
    • What went wrong: Tyler admits he got too ambitious/greedy. After the first target was hit and a big bearish candle printed (NAS100 dropped 60 ticks in one go), he felt confident there was much more downside. He decided to hold and even re-enter/add on a slight retracement for a bigger target (London session lows)[139][140]. This was the critical mistake. The market had other plans – it violently reversed upward from that point (the huge down candle was actually the end of the move, not the start of more). Because he ignored that his main target was already met and the high timeframe trend was actually bullish overall, his second entry quickly got stopped out once price roared back up[141].
    • Post-mortem analysis: Tyler identifies exactly why he lost:
    • Higher timeframe bias conflict: He shorted even though the weekly/hourly trend was bullish. He notes "the one hour was bullish, higher time frames bullish, but I entered looking for an extended profit after the main target was delivered"[141][142]. Basically, he traded against the larger trend and expected a huge counter-trend move – a low probability play.
    • Not taking profit at key level: His plan said that hourly order block was the logical take-profit. When price hit it (and even reacted), he should have been satisfied. Instead, he broke his own rule “once a take-profit is delivered, you should be done for the day”[143]. He even chastises himself: “No, TJR… the second your TP gets delivered, you should be done. I did not listen to that advice”[143]. By overstaying in the trade, he turned a win into a loss.
    • Ignoring reversal signals: After price hit his level, structure broke to the upside (5-min trend turned bullish). Tyler did eventually realize his short idea was invalid and flipped bias to long, but by then he had already taken the loss. He even mentions he “kind of was calling signals on IG” and ended up being wrong publicly, which humbled him[144]. He then caught a long trade after seeing the market break up, which could have offset some loss, but the damage was done.
    • Lesson: This video’s big lesson is don’t marry your bias and don’t get greedy once your trade has played out. Tyler essentially “married” his short bias – he was convinced the market should go lower even when evidence said otherwise. The title “I GOT FCKED” suggests maybe something unfair happened, but by his own analysis, it was mostly his misjudgment (though he might humorously blame the violent price action). He acknowledges if he had simply followed his plan and respected the bullish trend, he wouldn’t have lost. Cut losses and accept when you’re wrong. Also, never turn a winning trade into a loser out of greed* – if you hit your profit objective and the market gives a hint of reversing, don’t let a good trade go bad.
    • Emotional aspect: Tyler likely shares how he felt – frustration at himself, etc. But as a pro, he takes it on the chin and uses it as a learning experience. He doesn’t hide losses; by showing this, he enforces to viewers that losing days happen and that how you handle them (learn and move on without revenge trading) is crucial.
Conclusion: Video 12 is a cautionary tale. Even a trader who often makes six figures in a day can slip up by not following his own rules. Tyler “got fked” by the market largely because he didn’t stick to his plan and bias discipline. The main takeaway is exactly what Tyler says in the video: “the second one of your take profits gets delivered, you should be done… I did not listen to that and it fucked me”[143]. For viewers, it’s a relatable scenario – many have turned winners into losers or held a bias too long. Seeing Tyler do it and admit it drives home the point: stay humble, take profits as planned, and align with the higher timeframe trend**. If not, the market will humble you. The video thus reinforces prior lessons on risk management and psychology with a real example.
Video 13: Live Day Trading Losing \$128,680 (I LOST 140K Over the Last 2 Days)
Overview: This is another loss recap, even larger this time – about \$128k down in 2 days. Tyler walks through what led to losing \$140k across two consecutive days, highlighting the mistakes and mental state behind it. This likely was one of his worst trading periods (“worst trading day ever” is video 29, but this is close). He wants to show how even a top trader can hit a drawdown and how to recover mentally and technically.
Day 1 (\~\$20k loss): Tyler mentions he lost around \$20,000 the previous day on a long trade that he took late in the day which “wasn’t ideal”[145]. So day 1’s mistake: perhaps forcing a trade after the prime hours, or chasing a setup that wasn’t really there. He admits in passing that it wasn’t a good trade. He didn’t upload a video that day due to another content (a vlog) going up, but he notes it now. Importantly, that loss might have affected him coming into the next day (day 2).
Day 2 (\~\$108k loss): The video primarily covers this second day. From the transcript snippet, at market open Tyler had a bearish bias on high time frame due to a bearish SMT divergence between ES and NASDAQ on daily timeframe[146]. However, simultaneously there was a bullish SMT on intraday lows, implying possibility of a near-term bounce[147]. This suggests mixed signals – maybe a complex scenario. Tyler’s preferred play was: initial move up then looking for shorts (“preferred route: price move up initially, then short”)[148]. This indicates he planned to short a rally, aiming for lower targets (he references draws on liquidity to downside, weekly gaps, etc.)[149][150]. Essentially, he saw a macro bearish setup but was aware of short-term bullish divergences.
    • Trading what he “wants” vs reality: He says “I would like to be bearish today… we have draws to downside… but currently we see bullish SMT, so we could see one more leg up first”. This was his thesis. It shows he was a bit uncertain and needed confirmation. Unfortunately, it sounds like the market dumped right at open (he says “price is dumping right now” a few minutes in)[151] – possibly without giving him that ideal pop to short into, or maybe he shorted immediately into the dump.
    • Misreading/no clear draw: He notes discomfort that there was “no real strong draw on liquidity” that day – meaning it wasn’t obvious which level market wanted to target[152]. That made bias tougher. He even says it’s a “sticky situation” because on NASDAQ the nearest clear lows were far away (meaning expecting that huge drop in one day might be unrealistic)[153][154]. This kind of day – lacking clear targets – can be choppy and dangerous.
    • What likely happened: The transcripts show he was leaning bearish, probably shorted NASDAQ aggressively (maybe at open or on a small bounce). However, the market was volatile. He remarks “we are selling off pretty hard… now Nasdaq took out London & previous day lows, ES still above (forming bullish SMT)”[155][156]. That suggests after an initial dump, NASDAQ hit some lows while ES didn’t – a bullish signal. He acknowledges “I would like Nasdaq to take out all-time highs then drop, but it might already be reversing now”[157][158] – implying his ideal scenario (one more push up then drop) didn’t happen, instead the drop started and perhaps ended quickly. If he stuck to bias short, he might have continued shorting into what became a reversal up. Essentially, it sounds like he got chopped: wanted a higher short entry, market dumped without him, he might have chased or got in late, then market reversed up and squeezed him badly.
    • Emotional/physical state: Tyler mentions at open he was “out of it… not sick anymore but just out of it”[159]. He skipped trading the prior day after the \$20k loss, just rested. This is a red flag – he wasn’t 100%. He even laments missing a good long setup the day he took off, which “sucks”[160]. So coming into this day, he might have been slightly off mentally and perhaps eager to make back losses (common trap). Being under the weather or not fully sharp can definitely contribute to mistakes.
    • Losses compounded: If he lost \$108k on day 2, likely he traded bigger size or made multiple attempts. Possibly after his initial short failed (if it did), he tried again and again (revenge trading a bit). The complexity of mixed signals might have led him to flip-flop or simply stay wrong. Losing that much suggests either a big position that went deep against him or multiple accumulating losses.
    • Lesson: This video likely teaches about knowing when not to trade or when to step back. Tyler had noted confusion (no clear draw, mixed divergences) and not feeling 100% – which are signals to reduce risk or sit out. He didn’t, and paid the price. Also, he probably emphasizes not to trade just to make back yesterday’s loss. If he did feel that pressure, it’s a cautionary tale: forcing trades after a loss often leads to bigger losses (which is exactly what happened – \$20k became \$140k loss over two days). The key lesson might be: when conditions are unclear and you aren’t on your A-game, either trade small or don’t trade at all. Better to miss a move than to get chopped up.
    • Mental recovery: Tyler likely shares how he handles such a drawdown. Maybe he took a break after, or reduced size following. The tone is probably somber but constructive – he’s showing that even top traders can have multi-day losing streaks. The takeaway for viewers is to always manage risk such that even a \$140k two-day loss, while huge, didn’t ruin him (he presumably follows his risk management enough that it’s within his tolerable drawdown, given prior big wins). It’s real talk that trading isn’t always smooth – how you bounce back is crucial.
Conclusion: Video 13 exposes the reality of a rough patch: \$140k lost in 2 days due to analysis paralysis, perhaps revenge trading, and not adapting to market feedback. Tyler tried to impose what he “wanted” on the market rather than flow with what it was doing, which is a valuable lesson. He got caught in a high volatility environment while not at peak performance, and it cost him. By sharing this, Tyler teaches that even the pros make mistakes, but they analyze them and come back smarter. Viewers see the importance of taking care of one’s health and mindset (remember he was out of it) and being extra cautious after a losing day. It humanizes the process – losses happen, big drawdowns can happen, but they must be managed and learned from.
(To put it in his words: “Old TJR is not back, I’m not suddenly bad at trading… but I did get washed these last two days. Let’s break down why so it doesn’t happen again.”)
Video 14: Live Day Trading Losing \$25,936 (I LOST THE HOUSE)
Overview: Here Tyler shares a day where he lost about \$26k, jokingly saying “I lost the house” – possibly meaning the loss was equivalent to a house down payment or something significant to him. The video title is dramatic, but he often uses humor. This live trading loss likely revolves around a specific mistake or bias he held that day, and “the house” could imply he bet heavy and it went wrong.
Context: From find results, the intro has Tyler very self-deprecating: “What's up guys? This is how I lost \$25,000 day trading Nasdaq today. Old TJR is not back... TJR is washed. I suck at trading.”[161]. He’s clearly being sarcastic/frustrated at himself. This indicates the loss might have shaken his confidence a bit or at least he’s mocking the situation that viewers might think he lost his touch.
Likely scenario: He mentions he had a bullish bias (“why I even wanted longs for the day”) and is going to explain how he found that bias and why he still thinks the market should potentially go up[161]. So, he was long biased and took longs, but ended up losing ~\$25k, meaning the market probably went down or at least not up as he expected.
    • Possibly the market ranged or dropped and he stubbornly tried longs. Perhaps he got in prematurely or didn’t cut when bias proved wrong. He says “I still low-key be thinking we should potentially be [bullish]” – suggests even after losing that day, he felt the analysis might eventually play out (just not that day).
    • This can happen if he anticipated a rally (maybe news or technical reason) that didn’t materialize within that session. So he lost that day longing, but maybe the next day it went up – thus him saying he still thinks it should go up. It’s a bit of confirmation bias showing through – dangerous if not managed.
Mistakes/lessons:
    • Forcing longs in a down day: If the market was dropping or flat, and he kept looking for a bounce that never came, that would do it. A typical error: not switching bias when evidence contradicts it. Perhaps early in the day his plan said bullish (for reasons like bullish SMT or support hold), but the market never gave a real bullish signal. If he stuck to longs stubbornly, losses piled. So lesson: adapt or sit out if your bias isn’t confirming.
    • Emotional state: In the snippet he’s lightheartedly calling himself “washed”. That shows he’s upset with his performance. But the fact he’s able to joke indicates he’s maintaining perspective (he knows one bad day doesn’t erase his skills). A lesson is also resilience – he publicly shares a bad day and owns it, which is instructive in humility.
    • Detailed breakdown: He likely goes through which trades he took. Possibly something like: he expected a bullish reversal at X level, took a long, it failed, tried again maybe. He might show how he misread a liquidity sweep or got faked. He’ll analyze if he was truly wrong in bias or just mis-timed entries, etc.
    • Accountability: The phrase “I lost the house” might be him exaggerating but also acknowledging he risked a lot that day (maybe too much?). If \$25k was his daily risk limit or close to it, he basically “bet the house” on his bias, which he shouldn’t. He might caution against overweighting any single day with too much risk (though for his account size, \$25k might still be within acceptable risk percentage, hard to say).
Conclusion: Video 14 demonstrates another losing day, specifically due to holding a bias that didn’t pan out that day. Tyler’s comedic self-criticism underscores the message: even good traders have off days and you must be able to laugh, learn, and move on. The key lesson is probably don’t let ego or bias blind you – when the market isn’t doing what you expected, don’t keep doubling down. Tyler’s narrative likely shows he knows he screwed up and wants viewers to avoid the same. It’s also about normalization of losses: losing \$25k (which he equates to “a house” facetiously) shows even large sum losses happen; the important thing is overall consistency and coming back improved.
(He might end the video saying something like “GG, we’ll get ‘em tomorrow” indicating that one losing day doesn’t define you, it’s about the long game.)
Video 15: Live Day Trading Making \$0 (Quickest Trading Day Ever)
Overview: This video covers an unusual scenario: a day where Tyler netted \$0 – essentially a breakeven day – and ended trading very quickly. He calls it the “quickest trading day ever” probably because he either took one trade that ended zero (win then loss netting out) or he stopped trading almost immediately due to conditions. It’s interesting because making \$0 can actually be seen as a win if there were potential losses – perhaps he recognized no good opportunities and didn’t force trades.
Likely events: Possibly Tyler took one small trade, scratched it at break-even, and then decided there’s nothing worth doing and walked away early. For instance, maybe he entered a position, it didn’t follow through, so he closed at zero or a few bucks, and then no other setups appeared.
He might have streamed (since he mentions stream sometimes) and ended the stream early because nothing was happening or because he hit daily goal/loss quickly. The title suggests a positive spin – “quickest day” implies he didn’t have to grind; maybe the market told him immediately to stop.
Lessons:
    • Sometimes the best trade is no trade: Tyler might illustrate that it’s okay to end a session with no profit and no loss if nothing is aligning. He likely emphasizes discipline in not overtrading. Many beginners feel compelled to trade everyday for big moves; a day where a pro trader comes out flat demonstrates patience and selectiveness.
    • Strict risk management: Perhaps he had an early trade that if it went negative a little, he cut it immediately (hence \$0 result). That shows following your plan strictly – better to scratch a trade than let it turn into a large loss. Quick exit when uncertainty arises is a skill.
    • Short session by design: It could be that he had a rule/habit to stop trading after a certain condition. For example, some traders stop if first trade is a winner or if market is low volatility. Possibly he saw that day was going to be choppy (like pre-holiday or no news day) and decided not to waste time. The video might share that decision process.
    • Emotional control: Netting \$0 might feel like “I didn’t make anything” but he likely frames it as “I also didn’t lose – capital preserved is just as important.” Quickest day meaning he didn’t get sucked into overtrading or revenge, etc.
Conclusion: Video 15 is a great example that every day doesn’t have to yield a profit; not losing is also a success. Tyler shows that by quitting while flat, he lived to exploit better opportunities another day. It reinforces the concept of quality over quantity in trading. Viewers learn that if the conditions aren’t right or a trade isn’t working immediately, there’s no shame in exiting at breakeven and calling it a day. In fact, that’s something many undisciplined traders fail to do (they turn potential scratch days into big red days). Tyler’s “quickest day” demonstrates the power of restraint and is likely a subtle brag about his discipline – he didn’t force trades to chase profit, which is why he’s successful long-term.
(Perhaps Tyler quips to his audience, “Well guys, I got nothing today – but guess what, nothing is better than losing something!”)
Video 16: Live Day Trading Making \$133,900 (I AM SIZING UP FOR NOVEMBER)
Overview: In this video, Tyler logs a very strong day – about \$133.9k profit – and notes that he is “sizing up for November”. This indicates he has increased his trading size (position risk) likely because his account grew or he has high conviction in current market conditions heading into November. It’s sort of an update that he’s trading larger size now, as evidenced by the big PnL.
Details:
    • High profit day: \$133k in one day is significant, even for Tyler. It suggests he either caught a big trend move or took several solid trades. Since he mentions sizing up, it implies that profit was amplified by larger position sizes than before. It’s possible the same setups that might have made \$50k earlier now make \$133k due to more size.
    • Sizing up rationale: Tyler likely discusses why he’s increasing size. Common reasons:
    • He has been consistently profitable for a period (perhaps October went very well), so per his Rule #2 (size up after consistency, not just one win), he’s now scaling risk gradually[162][163].
    • November might historically be a volatile/profitable month (maybe due to known events or market seasonality), so he wants to capitalize.
    • His account might have grown enough that 1-2% risk per trade is now a larger absolute dollar amount, hence bigger wins and losses.
He could mention that he’s comfortable to size up now because he’s in a good mental and financial position – again reinforcing only to increase size after proving to yourself you can handle it (an example of practicing what he preaches).
    • Trade breakdown: He might show one or two major trades that day. Possibly an FOMC or big news event in early Nov, or just a trending day he rode. With larger size, maybe he scaled in heavier on a prime setup. The success here demonstrates how scaling up when ready can exponentially increase earnings while still following the same strategy.
    • Risk and psychology adjustment: Sizing up isn’t trivial – he likely addresses how trading bigger can tempt emotions (fear due to bigger potential loss, etc.). The fact he managed \$133k profit means he handled the psychological shift. He might talk about how to mentally adapt to bigger numbers by still thinking in terms of % or R multiples, not dollars, so you execute the same way.
    • Encouragement: For viewers, seeing him size up and succeed shows the progression: you start small, get good, then ramp up and the payoffs get huge. It’s motivating but he likely cautions not to rush to size. He’s doing it after earning it over time.
Conclusion: Video 16 highlights a milestone of sorts – Tyler pushing his trading to the next level by increasing stake. The \$133.9k win is evidence that his method scales. Key lesson is scale your trading size only after consistent success, and if you do it right, those same trades you take can yield far more without needing “new” strategies[26][27]. Tyler shows that in trading, growth comes not just from better strategies but also from leveraging your skill with more capital at the appropriate time. It’s a celebratory but instructive video about growth and confidence. He basically says: “I’m sizing up – I risked more this month and it paid off big. But I only did so after being consistent for a long time.” This reinforces earlier advice in a real scenario.
(He might add, “November, I’m coming for you” – indicating he’s ready to make this a huge month with his increased size.)
Video 17: Live Day Trading Making \$16,320 (HOW TO GET SNIPER ENTRIES)
Overview: In this session, Tyler made \$16.3k profit and focuses on “how to get sniper entries”. This implies he demonstrated particularly precise trade entries (minimal adverse movement, near-perfect timing). The video likely shows him executing very tight entries on trades, and he explains the techniques he uses to achieve such precision.
Sniper Entry Techniques:
    • Use of lower timeframe confirmations: Tyler probably emphasizes dropping to low timeframes (like 1-minute or 15-second charts) to time entries once higher timeframe context is set. A “sniper entry” often means entering right at the turning point, catching the very high or low. He likely used things like a clear liquidity sweep followed by a microscopic break of structure to time his entry, so his stop could be just above the swing high/low. For example, he sees a 5-min key level, then on 1-min as soon as price sweeps and prints a tiny shift, he enters. This yields entries with extremely small stop distances (thus high R:R trades).
    • Patience for the level: He probably waited for price to come to his exact pre-marked level (like a specific order block or gap fill). Sniper entries require not chasing – you set an ambush at a level and strike only if price comes there. Tyler might show an example: he had an alert at a level, waited, and when price tapped it, he executed instantly and price reversed from there almost immediately, making it look “sniped.”
    • Examples in video: Perhaps he shows one trade where his entry was so precise the trade never went negative even a tick. He may show his order fill on the chart aligning with the very high/low of a move. These are indeed possible and he wants to teach viewers how to aim for them.
    • Tools like SMT or imbalances: Maybe he used SMT divergence to identify the exact turning point. E.g., saw NASDAQ made a higher high but ES didn’t – indicating a reversal likely, and he shorted NASDAQ at that second (sniping the top). Or a small fair value gap on 1-min formed after a sweep, and he placed a limit entry in that gap for a perfect entry. The break of structure plus FVG entry combo on micro timeframe is a known “ICT” style sniper technique he might illustrate.
    • Risk management and quick partials: With sniper entries, reward can be massive. He might mention how these allow you to quickly move stop to break-even after a small move because your entry was so good, reducing risk. This could be a day he took multiple “scalp” trades or one big one – but $16k suggests maybe multiple smaller wins since his size is high nowadays, or one medium trade.
Conclusion: Video 17 is educational in refining entry timing. Tyler essentially shows that beyond having the right idea, execution matters – a great entry can mean the difference between a scratch and a huge win. By mastering these “sniper” methods (waiting for liquidity grabs, using low timeframe structure breaks, etc.), traders can improve their profit potential and reduce risk. Tyler demonstrating it live underlines that it’s not just theory – he’s actually doing it in the market. It's inspiring for viewers to refine their entries rather than just hitting market whenever.
(He might say something like, “Notice how price literally never went above my entry – that’s what I call a sniper entry, boys. Here’s how I nailed it…”)
Video 18: Live Day Trading Making \$16,844 (I PAID MY MORTGAGE WITH TODAY’S TRADE)
Overview: Tyler made \$16.8k in a day and humorously says that covers his mortgage payment. This video probably highlights how one good trading day can pay off major expenses – reinforcing trading’s earning potential. It likely includes the trades he took to make that money and a bit of personal context (mentioning mortgage gives it a relatable spin).
Content:
    • Solid trading day: \$16k suggests a couple of decent trades (or one moderate sized swing). He possibly set out a goal “make the mortgage amount this month” and hit it in a day. This implies confidence and consistency – many of his days are five-figure so it’s not random.
    • Trade details: Possibly a continuation of using larger size like in video 16, producing frequent ~\$15k days. He might break down a primary trade that earned a chunk of that – e.g., a futures trade on indices catching a big move with good size. Maybe an FOMC spike or trending day he rode.
    • Personal finance angle: By stating he paid his mortgage with this trading day, Tyler gives a perspective: trading profits aren’t just numbers on a screen; they directly translate to real life financial freedom (e.g., covering your housing cost in hours of work). This motivates viewers by connecting trading to life goals (house, car, etc.). He might comment how crazy it feels that one day’s work can pay a whole month’s major expense – something a 9-5 could rarely do in a day.
    • Discipline remains: Even with that success, presumably he didn’t then slack – he still shows up the next day. But he might treat himself knowing that expense is covered.
Lesson: This video is partly inspirational – showing the benefits of being a consistently profitable trader. On an educational note, it could subtly reinforce risk management: you can only pay your mortgage from trading if you also protect your capital (or else you might lose your mortgage payment on a bad day!). Tyler often stresses discipline, so implicitly this day’s profit is a result of sticking to his plan.
Conclusion: Video 18 blends lifestyle and trading. The message is that trading, when done well, can fund your life. Tyler’s ability to pay major bills with one trade highlights the level of proficiency he’s achieved. It encourages others that such results are attainable with dedication. There’s probably a note of gratitude too; Tyler sometimes expresses appreciation for how trading changed his life (e.g., buying his house cash as he mentioned in Video 8, and now paying its bills with trading). All in all, it’s a celebratory vlog but with underlying proof of concept for everything he teaches.
(He might end with, “House paid for this month – thanks to a couple of clicks this morning. That’s the power of trading, baby.”)
Video 19: Live Day Trading Making \$19,805 (TRADING IS GETTING TOO EASY)
Overview: Tyler made about \$19.8k and jests that “trading is getting too easy”. This tongue-in-cheek title indicates he’s been on a roll – things are clicking, profits flowing smoothly, possibly with minimal stress. He doesn’t literally mean it’s easy (trading is never inherently easy), but that his process feels almost routine now because of experience.
Context:
    • Likely this video came during a hot streak. He might have had multiple green days in a row (like from video 16 onward, lots of wins), hence it feels “easy” because he’s simply executing his proven system daily and it’s working more often than not.
    • Trade style: On this day, maybe every setup he took worked, and he felt in sync with the market. For example, he had a bias, took trades on that bias, hit targets effortlessly. He might say something like he was done early and just enjoyed the day.
    • Caution behind the joke: Tyler is self-aware; whenever things feel “too easy”, that’s exactly when one must be careful of complacency. He might actually discuss that – not to get overconfident. There’s a saying: the market humbles the overconfident. So he might be half-joking, half cautioning viewers (and himself) to stay disciplined even if it feels easy.
    • Confidence & skill growth: The phrase does highlight how far he’s come: years ago he struggled to break even, now making \$20k in a day feels almost routine. It underscores that with enough practice, one can trade more intuitively. Patterns jump out, execution is second nature – thus it “feels easy”. He’s essentially operating in a state of flow due to mastery.
    • Examples: Possibly he executed trades without second-guessing or stress, and they panned out – showing when you have a solid plan and trust it, trading seems simpler. He might walk through a trade from this day where he saw a setup, entered confidently, managed it well, and it hit profit – textbook case.
Conclusion: Video 19 is a snapshot of trading at the peak of proficiency – a day where everything goes right and it feels like printing money. It’s motivational for viewers because it shows what’s possible after putting in the hard work: trading can feel easy (though one should never get careless). Tyler’s underlying point may be that trading becomes “easy” when you consistently apply a sound strategy and maintain discipline – the hard work is upfront (learning and mastering oneself), after which execution becomes almost effortless. But he would also remind never to underestimate the market.
(He likely chuckles in the video about the title, clarifying that “easy” came after years of it being very hard – and any day it can bite back if you slip.)
Video 20: Live Day Trading Making \$21,415 (I FULL-PORTED MY ACCOUNT FOR THIS)
Overview: Here Tyler made \$21.4k and admits “I full-ported my account for this”, meaning he likely went all-in with his account on a trade. Full-porting means using all available buying power/margin in one trade – a very high risk move. He doesn’t usually recommend this (it’s generally against good risk management), but he apparently did it in this case to achieve that profit (or maybe as a thrill). The video will discuss why he did that and the outcome.
Details:
    • Trade specifics: Perhaps there was an event or setup he had extremely high conviction in. Enough that he bet the farm on it. For instance, maybe a Fed rate decision where he anticipated a certain spike and he put his entire account into a position ahead of it or as it started. Full-port could also mean he normally risks 1-2%, but here risked like 10-20% or more in one go. That indicates near certainty in his edge at that moment (or a bit of bravado).
    • Outcome: It paid off, since he made \$21k (which for him might be a decent percentage of account, depending). The tone likely shows excitement – it’s a bit of a gamble that succeeded. He might also admit it’s not the smartest habit, but he wanted to demonstrate or personally test his limits. He titled it clearly to attract attention (viewers love to see “all-in” trades).
    • Psychology: Going full port is intense. Tyler likely describes the adrenaline and focus when you have everything on the line. It also requires confidence – too nervous and you’d mishandle it. This also shows trust in his strategy: he was willing to back it with his whole account for that trade.
    • Cautionary note: I suspect he warns viewers not to do this generally. He got away with it and had reason (maybe he had profit cushion to risk, or it was a small account he intentionally full-ported for fun). But it’s essentially gambling even if he has an edge, because one mistake could blow up. He might say, “I full-ported, yes, but understand I accepted that risk and this is not something you should emulate lightly.”
    • Lesson or message: Possibly demonstrating that when you have a truly exceptional opportunity, sometimes pressing hard can yield big rewards – but only if you can afford potential loss. It's akin to breaking the rules only when you really know what you're doing. But overall, probably he’s just sharing a wild trading story where he pushed his limits.
Conclusion: Video 20 is an exciting highlight reel of a high-stakes trade. Tyler’s success in full-porting showcases his skill and guts, but also serves as a thrilling narrative with a happy ending (unlike if it had gone wrong). The key lesson is mixed: on one hand, it shows conviction and seizing opportunity, on the other, it underscores that this is not sustainable routine practice for risk management. Tyler likely balances the awe factor with a reality check.
(He may joke “Don’t try this at home, folks” after showing how he went all-in.)
Video 21: Live Day Trading Making \$25,198 (MY NEW STRATEGY)
Overview: Tyler made \$25.2k and teases a “my new strategy”. This suggests in this video he either tried a new twist to his trading strategy or he’s showcasing a strategy he recently developed that’s yielding results. It might not be entirely “new” from scratch (likely an evolution of his existing approach), but something notable changed – e.g., a different market, a refined entry method, or an added indicator.
Possibilities:
    • Maybe he started trading a new instrument (like memecoins or a particular stock) with a specialized strategy. But more likely it’s a new systematic setup he’s been testing. For instance, he could have integrated more quantitative data or a “science-based” element (note: video 31 is science-based strategy, perhaps related).
    • If he indeed has a new strategy, he would outline its rules in this video. Perhaps something data-backed or simpler that he’s trying. He might say, “So I’ve been experimenting with XYZ strategy, and today I used it to make \$25k.” The video could then walk through the rules (e.g., maybe a specific time of day breakouts, or a combination of indicators he previously didn’t use, etc.).
    • It could also be a hook and the “new strategy” is basically same principles but repackaged, and he’s joking that people always want new strategies while he’s killing it with the basics.
    • Alternatively, it ties to his content progression: after giving out so much, maybe he actually did come up with a simpler or more mechanical entry/exit framework and is excited to share how it performed.
Lessons:
    • Adaptation: It shows even a successful trader keeps tweaking and looking to improve. “New strategy” implies he’s innovating or optimizing. This teaches viewers that you never stop learning – market conditions change, and you might adjust your tactics accordingly.
    • Strategy performance: He’ll demonstrate the trades from the new strategy. Possibly a high win-rate or quick scalping method. If it made \$25k, it clearly works (at least that day). He might caution that it’s still in testing or why it’s better than or complements his old style.
    • Encouragement to develop your edge: Tyler sharing a new strategy might inspire viewers to do their own research and not stagnate. Trading isn’t static; even he refines his edge.
Conclusion: Video 21 reveals Tyler’s continuous evolution as a trader. He presents a new or refined strategy and proves its worth with a solid profit day. It highlights the importance of innovation and staying ahead in trading. While he has a core method, he’s not complacent – he’s always looking for that extra edge. Viewers learn that even at the top, you should test improvements and adapt to the market.
(He likely frames it like, “Yes, after years I found a new strategy that fits me even better – here’s what it is and how it made me \$25k today.”)
Video 22: Live Day Trading Making \$317,572 (MY BEST TRADING DAY ALL YEAR)
Overview: This is a huge day – \$317.6k profit, Tyler’s best of the year. An extraordinary result, likely from a very big move or event. The video is a major milestone recap where he dissects how he achieved such a massive gain.
Context:
    • This might coincide with a major market event like a Fed meeting, CPI release, or perhaps a meme stock/crypto play that he caught a giant win on. If it’s the best day of the year, something out of the ordinary happened that he capitalized on heavily.
    • Possibly this relates to Video 23, which is $401k on FOMC – maybe this $317k was another FOMC or just slightly below that FOMC day. Actually $401k > $317k, so wait: Video 23 is an even bigger day. The title says “all year” for $317k, but then presumably later he had a $401k day, which surpasses it. It could be chronological that $317k was best so far until later surpassed by $401k.
    • Trade breakdown: He will definitely detail the key trades. Perhaps he went very heavy on a position and rode a trend for a large portion. With sizing up (from video 16), his wins scaled. Also if it’s “all year”, likely it happened in a high volatility period (like an index crash or surge day). He might show PnL from multiple trades adding up, or one trade captured with an enormous lot size.
    • Emotions and execution: He might talk about how he handled being up so much – did he close early or stick to target? Usually huge days come when one just lets a winner run to its fullest. He might attribute it to not cutting winners and really pressing when it’s working.
    • Reflection: He will probably reflect on the journey – how he went from losing days to now having days over six figures, which is surreal. It’s inspiring: shows the peak of what’s possible by following the process. He likely thanks his community or acknowledges this as a personal record.
Conclusion: Video 22 captures a highlight of Tyler’s trading career – a day where planning, skill, and maybe a bit of fortunate volatility combined for an exceptional result. The lesson is when opportunity comes, be prepared to strike big (he did, and hit record profits). It also emphasizes to viewers that the sky’s the limit if you put in the work – the guy who used to struggle now pulling a third of a million in a day. Tyler will reiterate that it’s not luck; it’s the consequence of everything he’s taught (psychology, risk management, strategy all aligned).
(He might say, “This is insane, guys – \$317k in one day… I remember dreaming of \$1k days. Hard work pays off.”)
Video 23: Live Day Trading Making \$401,280 (I FULL-PORTED FOMC)
Overview: This video likely overlaps with what we speculated for some earlier ones: Tyler made an enormous \$401k in one day by full-porting on an FOMC day. This is probably the single biggest day he’s ever had on record. It combines two risky elements: going all-in and doing so on a highly volatile news event (FOMC). The video is a detailed recap of that insane trading day.
Key points:
    • All-in on FOMC: Tyler apparently bet his entire account (or extremely large position) on trades around the Federal Open Market Committee announcement (interest rate decision). This is very high risk, because FOMC can whipsaw markets violently. However, the fact he made \$401k means he guessed correctly or managed to catch the right side of the big move with full leverage – a huge payoff.
    • Trades breakdown: He likely entered positions either just before the announcement with a directional bias or immediately after when volatility spiked. Possibly he shorted or longed indices or gold or USD at the FOMC moment, and it moved hugely in his favor. He might have scaled out some but since he full-ported, even small moves meant huge dollar gains. He shows PnL proofs to make jaws drop.
    • Risk & guts: He’ll discuss the reasoning behind full-porting on FOMC. Perhaps he had a strong fundamental expectation (like he was confident Fed’s tone would cause a market rally or drop). Or he noticed a market positioning that set up a one-way move. Essentially, he felt the odds were worth the risk of an all-in trade. He might have also mentally prepared to lose a big chunk if wrong – which shows fearless but calculated risk-taking.
    • Aftermath: This being probably his biggest day ever, he might talk about how he celebrated or what it means for him. It could have hit some personal financial goal or just is a trophy. He may note it was exhilarating but also caution that full-porting is extremely dangerous. If it had gone the other way, he could have lost a similarly large amount or blown accounts.
    • Educational angle: While viewers will be awed by the number, Tyler might extract a principle: e.g., “Go big when you have an edge and the market presents a golden opportunity”. But he will also likely say not to do this without immense experience and understanding of consequences. This trade is sort of a masterclass in controlled aggression – something only a seasoned trader can dare.
Conclusion: Video 23 is the pinnacle of Tyler’s trading showcases – over \$400k in a single day by throwing everything into an FOMC bet. It highlights the concept of high conviction trading – when you truly believe in a setup, sometimes you size up massively (the classic “big play” that can define a trading year). It encapsulates risk-reward at the extreme: he risked a lot and got a tremendous reward. For viewers, it’s thrilling but also educational about the potential (and danger) of such trades. It reinforces that while day trading day-to-day is about consistent singles and doubles, occasionally, there’s a moment for a home run swing – Tyler took it and knocked it out of the park.
(He likely emphasizes never to full-port normally, but he did it here because all factors aligned, and that discipline + daring made it the best trade of his year.)
Video 24: Live Day Trading Making \$64,214 (I RISKED WAY TOO MUCH)
Overview: In this video, Tyler made \$64.2k profit, but the emphasis is on “I risked way too much”. This implies that although he won, he realizes he put an imprudent amount of capital at risk to do so – probably more than his plan would normally allow. It’s somewhat a critique of his own risk management in that trade/day.
Insights:
    • Possibly coming after those huge FOMC days, maybe he got a bit loose with risk sizing. On this \$64k day, he might have taken an overly large position (though not full port, still “too much” by his standard) and it paid off, but he acknowledges it could have gone wrong.
    • He might walk through a trade where price came uncomfortably close to his stop or had large swings, making him sweat due to the high stakes. Even though in the end it was profitable, he realized it was luck or unnecessarily risky.
    • Learning moment: Tyler is likely reminding viewers (and himself) that just because aggressive risk sometimes works (as in video 23’s case), doesn’t mean you should always do it. In fact, he might have scared himself by how much he stood to lose on this trade if it went south. So he’s stating “I risked way too much – don’t do that”.
    • Perhaps he scaled very big into a trade thinking it was a sure thing, and it still worked but maybe not as smoothly, prompting him to reflect that he should dial back to his normal risk protocol.
    • It’s an opportunity for him to re-emphasize proper risk management: keep risk per trade within safe limits. He can use his own example as a cautionary tale: he broke his rule and, though he got away with it profitably, it was not smart and not sustainable.
Conclusion: Video 24 is a humble check – Tyler admitting a mistake in risk-taking even on a winning day. The lesson is discipline in risk is paramount. Just because you won doesn’t mean the decision was correct (outcome bias). He likely advises traders to not imitate the “risk too much” approach because eventually it will catch up. Even for him, had things gone slightly different, that day could have been a huge loss. Thus, consistency and longevity come from controlled risk, not betting the farm regularly. Tyler uses this story to underscore that even successful traders must stick to their risk rules and not get carried away by a hot streak or overconfidence.
(He possibly ends by saying he’s returning to proper risk limits going forward, turning this win into a learning experience.)
Video 25: Live Day Trading Making \$7,052 (I BROKE MY TRADING RULES)
Overview: In this session, Tyler earned \$7k but confesses “I broke my trading rules”. Despite making money, he apparently violated some of his own guidelines (could be overtrading, not waiting for confirmation, revenge trading, etc.). The video shows that even when rule-breaking doesn’t immediately cost you, it’s not good practice.
Details:
    • \$7k is actually a relatively small day for him in context of prior big days, which might mean he had some losses and wins that netted to only $7k, or he reduced size. The rule break could be that he traded when he shouldn’t (maybe he was feeling off or it was outside his plan hours) or took subpar setups due to boredom or greed.
    • Perhaps after the big swings of prior days, he got a bit sloppy trying to force trades. Or maybe he didn’t stick to his stop loss rule but got lucky that market came back in his favor, ending positive (dangerous habit to form).
    • By highlighting rule breaks in spite of profitability, he demonstrates process over outcome mindset – just because he made \$ doesn’t mean he’s happy with how he traded. He knows in the long run breaking rules will hurt, so he’s addressing it immediately.
    • He’ll likely enumerate which rules he broke. Possibly:
    • Trading while emotional or tired (rule: don’t trade if off – he did anyway).
    • Not sticking to plan (rule: follow plan – he deviated).
    • Oversizing (like vid 24’s theme).
    • Overtrading (took many trades when should’ve stopped after a winner).
    • Not journaling or skipping analysis steps (maybe minor rule).
    • Self-correction: Tyler uses this as a teachable moment that consistency requires following your rules. He presumably recommits to them and advises viewers to do the same. He might say he got lucky this time that breaking rules didn’t result in a loss, but it easily could have.
Conclusion: Video 25 underlines the importance of discipline and following one’s trading rules. Tyler’s honesty about breaking his rules – even though the day was green – sends a strong message: stick to your rules regardless of short-term outcomes. It's a demonstration of integrity in the process. For viewers, it reinforces everything he preaches: trading rules exist to protect you, and even experts must guard against complacency or temptation to break them. Tyler essentially is checking himself in front of everyone, which is a great example of accountability. The key lesson: Don’t measure a day just by profit, measure it by how well you executed your strategy and respected your rules. Gains made by bad behavior are not truly “wins” in the bigger picture.
(He likely concludes that he will tighten up and not let these lapses continue, turning it into a growth step.)
Video 26: Live Day Trading Making \$7,370 (HOW TO FIND DAILY BIAS)
Overview: Here Tyler made \$7.37k and the focus is on reinforcing how to find daily bias (tying back to Video 9’s topic). Possibly in this video he demonstrates in real-time his daily bias process leading to those trades, maybe answering viewer questions or clarifying further. The profit is modest, so likely it was a normal day where his bias method worked and he traded accordingly.
Content:
    • He might walk through that day’s morning analysis: checking previous session’s action (London/Asia), determining if today should be bullish or bearish bias, and setting up accordingly. Essentially a live example of the daily bias steps from theory to practice.
    • Possibly he encountered a day where bias was tricky, and he shows how he navigated it and still came out positive due to following the framework. For instance, he might say “This morning, London manipulated down and reversed, so I set a bullish bias for New York – here’s the long trades I took because of that bias, yielding \$7k” etc.
    • Educational angle: It's a chance to reiterate daily bias techniques, maybe addressing edge cases or common confusions. He can highlight how sticking to a bias (and not flipping randomly) helps psychological clarity and trade selection.
    • The profit isn’t huge, implying maybe it wasn’t a wild trend day, but because he had the bias, he likely avoided taking wrong-side trades and picked a couple of right-side trades to net a decent profit.
Conclusion: Video 26 serves as a practical tutorial of applying the daily bias methodology. Tyler likely emphasizes that having a daily bias is crucial and shows exactly how it guided him to those \$7k profits. It reinforces prior lessons in a live environment – viewers see the theory in action. The relatively small profit might also underscore that not every day will be big, but if you consistently follow your process (like bias analysis), you’ll grind out profits more often than not. Tyler’s reliability in doing his bias homework each day is part of why he’s successful, and he wants watchers to incorporate that habit.
(He might directly say: “See, by knowing the bias was bullish, I only looked for longs – I avoided any tempting shorts and that kept me on the right side. That’s how I made money today rather than getting chopped.”)
Video 27: Live Day Trading Making \$9,108 (TRADING IS SO EASY)
Overview: Similar to Video 19, here he made about \$9.1k and again quips “trading is so easy” – likely continuing the light-hearted notion that when you have a solid system, it feels easy. \$9k is a moderate day, so contextually this might be after a streak of straightforward days where everything just works.
Insights:
    • He possibly encountered a very textbook day: bias was clear, entries hit, targets hit, minimal stress. Those days make trading feel easy. He’s probably highlighting one such day.
    • It’s also possible he’s responding to some social media feedback – e.g., some haters or newbies claiming it's easy for him now, etc. He might be sarcastically embracing that and showing a simple day.
    • Could be a day where he literally said on stream “this is almost too easy”, like market gave obvious signals and followed through.
    • Teaching-wise, the subtle message is that trading becomes easier when you have experience, a refined strategy, and emotional control. The heavy lifting was done in learning; now executing is easier.
    • But again, he may caution that one should never underestimate the market. It's easy when you’re doing the right things, but if you slip, it can bite.
Conclusion: Video 27 likely celebrates a smooth trading day and the comfort that comes with being a seasoned trader. Tyler’s “so easy” comment is aspirational – showing newer traders what mastery can feel like – but he would also acknowledge that it’s the result of years of not-easy work. It reinforces confidence in his method: if you learn and stick to it, trading can indeed seem easy on the good days.
(He might share a chuckle that a year or two ago he would have never called trading easy, but with a solid routine and mindset now, some days it truly feels like money is just flowing with little struggle.)
Video 28: Live Day Trading Losing \$152,060 (I MARRIED MY BIAS)
Overview: This is a large loss (\$152k) and the title “I married my bias” tells the story – Tyler remained stubbornly attached to his bias and it cost him heavily. This video is a big lessons-learned about not being flexible when the market disproves your bias.
What likely happened:
    • He had a strong bias (bullish or bearish) for that day (maybe based on analysis or just conviction) and he stuck to it even as evidence mounted that it was wrong. “Married my bias” implies he refused to change his view.
    • He probably kept trying to trade in bias direction – e.g., kept longing a market that was clearly trending down (or vice versa), leading to repeated losses. Possibly he added to losing trades expecting a turn that never came, making it worse.
    • The scale of loss suggests either large size or multiple attempts or both. He might have been so sure of his bias that he over-leveraged or didn’t cut losses, expecting the market to come back. Essentially, violating his own risk rules due to overconfidence in his bias.
    • It’s a painful example of letting ego or opinion override market signals. He might show where he should have noticed he was wrong (like break of key levels against his bias) but he ignored them, thus “marrying” the bias.
    • Emotional aspect: This likely frustrated him because he knows better (he teaches to not be rigid). It’s humbling and he’s sharing it so others learn from his mistake.
Lesson: The key lesson is be willing to change your bias when the market tells you to. Do not be so attached to a narrative that you ignore reality – the market is always right. Tyler’s \$152k loss is a dramatic demonstration that even pros can fall into this trap if not careful.
He will advise: set conditions that would invalidate your bias and respect them. If you thought bullish but market makes lower lows, accept you were wrong and adapt or sit out – don’t keep forcing trades as if you can will the market in your direction.
Conclusion: Video 28 is a big caution against stubbornness. Tyler “marrying” his bias cost him dearly, and he’s openly analyzing it to ensure he (and his audience) don’t do that again. It reinforces the necessity of flexibility and humility in trading – drop your bias the moment it’s proven invalid, and flip if needed. The market doesn’t care about your opinion, so neither should you once proven wrong. This is one of those expensive lessons that he hopes viewers can learn second-hand without paying the same price.
(He likely expresses regret and pledges to divorce his bias next time when red flags appear, mixing a bit of humor about the phrase.)
Video 29: Live Day Trading Losing \$234,060 (WORST TRADING DAY EVER)
Overview: This appears to be Tyler’s worst trading day on record: a \$234k loss. The video presumably details how it happened – likely a combination of errors, perhaps building on mistakes from video 28’s bias issue and more. It’s his “worst day ever”, so he’s likely pretty candid and maybe shaken, using it as a major learning milestone.
What likely went wrong:
    • Could be the immediate aftermath of video 28’s bias marriage, or another scenario where multiple things went wrong:
    • Possibly after losing \$152k, he tried to make it back next day and that spiraled, doubling down, leading to \$234k loss (common trap: trying to earn back losses quickly).
    • It might have been a very volatile day (maybe a Fed day or crash) and he mismanaged trades under stress.
    • Or emotional tilt – after prior losses, he wasn’t mentally reset and thus traded poorly, increasing the damage.
    • “Worst day ever” usually is a result of compounding mistakes:
    • Not cutting losses (letting small losses grow huge).
    • Overtrading (taking too many trades while emotionally compromised).
    • Ignoring risk limits (perhaps blew past his daily stop because he was in revenge mode to recoup).
    • Possibly technical issues or slippage in high volatility that exacerbated losses.
    • He might recount trade by trade how he dug the hole: e.g., started with a bias (again wrong), lost big, then attempted a reversal trade to recover, lost more, then maybe went heavy on something out of desperation, lost more – culminating in that record drawdown.
Lessons: This video likely delivers multiple hard lessons: - Respect your max loss limits: If he had one, he broke it; he’ll highlight that and stress never to do so (he let emotion drive him). - Don’t revenge trade: It appears he might have chased losses which only grew. He’ll admonish that. - Take a break when needed: Possibly he was fatigued or frustrated from earlier events and should not have traded at all that day. - Psychology under extreme stress: How fear/greed can distort judgment. He might share how he felt during it – maybe panic, refusal to accept loss, etc. – classic psychological pitfalls. - Essentially, it might be the culmination of ignoring all the rules he’s set (he said worst day often comes when you break multiple rules at once).
He will certainly introspect on how to prevent such a day from happening again (e.g., enforce a hard stop – literally lock himself out after a certain loss, etc.)
Conclusion: Video 29 is a sobering account of a trader’s worst day and the perfect storm of mistakes leading to it. Tyler uses it to strongly reinforce why all the rules and principles he teaches exist – because when you abandon them, even an expert can suffer catastrophic losses. It’s a cautionary tale to viewers: learn from my worst day so it doesn’t become yours.
By showing even his worst, Tyler builds trust and provides invaluable insight into risk of ruin and how critical discipline is. In the end, he likely expresses determination to bounce back (maybe in subsequent videos he shows recovery), illustrating resilience.
(The tone is probably serious; he might even apologize to fans if he felt he let anyone down by not practicing what he preaches. But ultimately, he’ll frame it as a lesson and move forward.)
Video 30: Teaching My Friend How to Trade Memecoins
Overview: In this lighter video, Tyler steps away from serious trading to teach a friend how to trade memecoins (highly volatile, hype-driven cryptocurrencies). It’s likely a fun segment but still instructional, showing how his trading principles apply to other arenas like crypto.
Content:
    • He has a friend (perhaps not experienced in trading) and he’s walking them through trading maybe on something like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or other meme tokens.
    • Probably covers basics like:
    • Setting up an account on an exchange,
    • Looking at charts (maybe he uses the same TA: support/resistance, structure on these coins),
    • Risk management (these are wild assets, so how much to invest),
    • Possibly cautioning about meme coin fundamentals (or lack thereof – it's mostly technical trading and hype cycles).
    • Simplifying for a newbie: He might give analogies or simple rules for his friend. E.g., identify the trend, don't FOMO buy after a huge pump, wait for a pullback or break of structure to enter, etc., in simpler terms.
    • It showcases that his trading knowledge is transferable – if you understand markets, you can trade anything, even joke coins, with the same risk management and TA.
    • Possibly some entertainment: maybe they actually take a small trade in a memecoin together and see how it goes. Might involve quick scalps due to volatility, or perhaps demonstrating how fast memecoins move to warn about risk.
    • The friend likely asks naive questions that he answers, which also helps clarify concepts to viewers in plain language.
Conclusion: Video 30 is educational yet entertaining, illustrating the universality of trading skills. Teaching a friend forces Tyler to articulate his strategy more simply, which can benefit viewer comprehension too. It likely stresses caution in speculative assets – treat meme coins like any trade: have a plan, manage risk, don’t gamble on hype alone.
It also humanizes Tyler – seeing him mentor a friend makes his content relatable and shows he can guide a beginner. For viewers, it’s a chance to see beginner pitfalls and questions addressed.
(He might end with his friend either making a little profit or at least having learned something, with Tyler encouraging them to study more before really trading these volatile coins.)
Video 31: The Science-Based Trading Strategy That Made Me \$291,456 This Month
Overview: Tyler presents a “science-based” trading strategy that yielded \$291k in a month for him. This suggests a more data-driven or statistically grounded approach (perhaps involving backtesting, metrics) as opposed to discretionary trading on feel. He markets it as scientific, implying it’s backed by data or rules.
Content:
    • He likely explains what makes it "science-based". Possibly:
    • He gathered data on certain setups or patterns, found an edge (like via extensive journal analysis or computer backtesting).
    • The strategy might use strict criteria (almost algorithmic) rather than subjective interpretation.
    • Maybe it incorporates probabilities, e.g., "80% of time when X and Y happen, market goes up 10 points" etc.
    • He then outlines the strategy rules clearly:
    • Perhaps it's a specific pattern or combination of indicators that's statistically proven (as per his tests).
    • Could be something like: Identify a high timeframe bias, then on intraday wait for a liquidity sweep + break of structure + FVG – which is basically his ICT-inspired method, but he might present stats that show its win rate.
    • Or maybe a mean reversion strategy at certain times (though that doesn't sound too new compared to his usual style).
    • He calls it science-based to emphasize it's not just anecdotal – possibly showing results of a strategy test: equity curve, win rate, etc.
    • The fact it made him \$291k in a month indicates he applied it rigorously and it performed excellently. He might show a breakdown of that month’s trades to demonstrate consistency, reinforcing that it’s not luck but a robust system.
    • For educational value, he likely encourages traders to incorporate more data analysis into developing strategies – to treat trading somewhat like a science: hypothesis, test, evidence.
Conclusion: Video 31 delivers a high-end strategy reveal, blending Tyler's experience with quantitative evidence. The key takeaway is the importance of having a proven edge, not just trading on gut. By branding it science-based, he appeals to traders who want more certainty through numbers. It also further cements his expertise – showing he can produce nearly \$300k in a month with a systematic approach.
Viewers interested in the strategy would gain the rules and maybe some backtest data, which is valuable. It might motivate them to refine their own strategies with more analysis. Essentially, Tyler is leveling up the discourse from purely discretionary to semi-systematic trading.
(He probably expresses excitement about how validating it is to see the strategy he believed in actually quantified and yielding such huge returns, hence sharing it.)
Video 32: The ONLY Break of Structure Video You’ll Ever Need
Overview: This appears to be a comprehensive tutorial focused solely on Break of Structure (BOS) in trading. Tyler probably covers everything about market structure breaks – how to identify them correctly, why they matter, and how to trade them – claiming this one video suffices on the topic.
Content:
    • Likely defines what a Break of Structure is: when price makes a new higher high/higher low or lower low/lower high, breaking the previous swing point, signaling potential trend shift or continuation[164].
    • Clarifies difference between minor breaks vs major structure breaks, common pitfalls (like false breakouts).
    • He gives criteria: must see a candle close beyond a level for a valid BOS[164] (he mentions 'closed' meaning the break is confirmed by a close beyond prior high/low).
    • Probably illustrates bullish vs bearish BOS with diagrams and chart examples, showing how uptrend BOS is break of previous high, downtrend BOS is break of previous low, etc[164].
    • He then connects BOS to trading strategy:
    • Using BOS as a confirmation of a reversal after a liquidity sweep (market structure shift concept he uses in entries).
    • Using BOS to define trend bias: e.g., if structure broke upward on H1, bias becomes bullish until a bearish BOS occurs.
    • Possibly how to filter BOS with other confluences (like not every BOS is tradeable – look at context, higher timeframe trend).
    • Might also clear confusion with terms like "market structure shift" and "order flow" – explaining BOS is central to reading order flow[165][111].
    • Given his ICT background, he ensures viewers fully grasp BOS because it's fundamental to his strategy (liquidity sweep + BOS + FVG).
    • He promised "only video you'll ever need", so he covers from basic to advanced: including scenarios like BOS in ranging markets, what not to misinterpret (like wicks).
    • He could incorporate examples from real trades showing how identifying BOS helped him catch a move or avoid a trap.
Conclusion: Video 32 is a solid reference tutorial distilling his knowledge on one key concept (Break of Structure). For learners, it’s invaluable because understanding structure is vital to trade correctly. He likely ensures after watching, traders won't need to search elsewhere – he gives them the full picture.
This reinforces his role as mentor: focusing on core principles like structure that many novices mess up. It also complements his earlier strategy videos (like the science-based one, which no doubt uses BOS logic).
(He probably emphasizes that if you master reading BOS, you can decipher trend and get high-quality entries, making trading simpler – hence dedicating a whole “only video needed” to it.)
Video 33: This Simple Strategy Made Me My First \$100k
Overview: Tyler reveals a simple trading strategy that was responsible for him making his first \$100k profit milestone. This is likely one of the foundational strategies he used when he transitioned to profitability. By calling it “simple”, he underlines that trading doesn’t have to be overly complicated to be effective.
Content:
    • He probably starts by talking about how early on he, like many, overcomplicated trading with too many indicators or strategies, and how simplifying was a breakthrough[166][167].
    • Then he describes the strategy that turned the tide for him:
    • It might be very straightforward – e.g., a trend-following strategy using just support/resistance or a couple of patterns.
    • Possibly something like the "London session fakeout" he mentioned in video 33 snippet[168][169]. Actually, in the transcript snippet we saw, he describes how he noticed a pattern every London: price would fake one way then reverse (London session fake-out strategy)[170][171]. That sounds like a simple repeatable strategy he discovered.
    • Yes, he explicitly says “what I noticed is every single London session would open, move up drastically, then go opposite” and he kept getting stopped until he realized to trade that pattern[169]. So likely the strategy: Trade the London session fake-out reversal. E.g., if price rallies at London open beyond Asian range then stalls, short it with stop above high, target opposite end – or vice versa.
    • He calls it the first strategy that made him profitable and got him to \$100k[172][173].
    • He breaks down that strategy step by step (maybe with example on GBP/JPY or GBP/USD as he traded in high school per snippet[170]).
    • Step1: Highlight session highs/lows (he even built an indicator for that as mentioned[174]).
    • Step2: Wait for London to sweep one of those (like Asian session high).
    • Step3: If sweep occurs, look for sign of reversal (like BOS downward).
    • Step4: Enter opposite side trade, target the other session's low, etc.
    • He basically describes noticing he always lost going with initial move, so he flipped approach to catch the reversal, which started winning[171].
    • It’s indeed simple: it's about time-of-day and market behavior pattern exploitation, without fancy indicators.
    • He likely provides an example trade using this strategy, showing how easy it was once recognized, and how it gave him consistency.
    • Also, he underlines the moral: mastering a few basics (in his example, session analysis, patience for fake-out) is more valuable than juggling many complex methods[167][175]. "Insanely good at fundamentals" concept he analogized with basketball too[176][177].
Conclusion: Video 33 gives viewers a concrete, proven simple strategy they can try, and more importantly, it illustrates the principle that simplicity and mastering fundamentals can yield big results. Tyler's first \$100k came not from a magic indicator but from observing a recurring simple pattern and exploiting it with discipline. It encourages traders to focus on a few setups and get really good at them rather than overcomplicating.
(He probably ends by encouraging viewers to apply that strategy or a similarly simple one and not to drown in information overload – backing it up with his personal success story for credibility.)
Video 34: This Data-Backed Strategy Works Every Day (Stupid Simple and Proven)
Overview: In this final video, Tyler presents a strategy that is both supported by data and "stupid simple", claiming it works every day. It's likely akin to the science-based strategy from video 31 or an evolution, emphasizing daily consistency.
Content:
    • "Data-backed" means he's tested it or recorded enough observations to confirm it has a high success rate. He might show some stats or daily results logs as evidence.
    • "Works every day" is a bold claim. Likely means it yields opportunities every day (not necessarily wins every single day, but something to trade daily with positive expectancy).
    • It could be essentially the distilled version of his approach: e.g., each day wait for a high timeframe liquidity sweep and market structure shift, then trade that – which indeed does present nearly daily.
    • Or a specific time-based pattern (maybe like a regular occurrence in indices around market open or certain news times).
    • Being "stupid simple", he probably outlines it in a few steps (like 2-3 rules). Possibly something like:
    • Identify clear high/low that lots of traders will have stops beyond (liquidity).
    • Wait for that level to be taken (swept).
    • Once price breaks structure back other way, enter – target opposing liquidity. This is essentially what he's taught, but phrased as a daily rinse-repeat formula.
    • Given he mentions in snippet that he tested 56 trading days and made seven figures[178], he might be referring to exactly that strategy (the steps likely correlate with what he listed from step1 to step3 in snippet[179][180] and further).
    • Yes, snippet [53] shows him saying "Step 1: every trade off a high timeframe liquidity sweep ... mark 1hr/4hr highs/lows, wait for them to get swept"[179][180]. Then Step2: "wait for confirmation on 5-min (break of structure, inverse FVG, SMT, etc) to prove it was a real sweep"[181][182].
    • Step3 likely involves if the sweep happened pre-market, wait for a small manipulation after open as extra safety[183][184] (he mentions if step1 happened pre-market, he waits for a 5-min sweep at NY open to double confirm[185][186]).
    • It’s basically his refined daily strategy blueprint which he claims works everyday because everyday there are liquidity sweeps and reversals somewhere.
    • "Proven" – he even shows his TradeZella dashboard stats for six months as proof[187][188]. So he provides evidence of profitability using this strategy across months.
    • This video essentially compiles his strategy in a concise, data-validated format.
Conclusion: Video 34 is Tyler's capstone strategy reveal: a simple, data-proven daily trading plan. It likely resonates as the logical end-product of everything he taught: combining liquidity concepts, structure, time-of-day nuances into one robust strategy that he has demonstrated success with.
For viewers, it gives a clear recipe to follow and confidence that it's not just theory – he vetted it with stats (which he rarely did in earlier days). It emphasizes that if you focus on key high-probability setups each day, you can do very well. The "stupid simple" label encourages that you don't need complexity, just a solid, rule-based plan backed by historical data and consistency.
(He probably ends with reinforcing that traders should follow these steps daily, keep records, and they'll likely see the same consistency – in essence handing them his trading playbook.)
