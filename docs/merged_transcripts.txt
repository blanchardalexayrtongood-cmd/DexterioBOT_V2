=== VIDEO 1/34 : 5_000_000_With_Day_Trading_At_23-[fmLqRceJaYU].txt
============================================

$5 million. That's how much I've made through day trading at the age of 23. And just like most of you guys, just like every other trader, I went through a bunch of trial and error to be able to get to where I'm at. And in fact, it took over two years of making mistakes, learning lessons, and trying to overcome all the mistakes in order to turn properly. In this video, I'm going to give you guys my full blueprint so you guys can literally just copy me. Let's get into it. So obviously, like I was saying, everything wasn't just sunshine and rainbows when I first started trading. In fact, it was actually one of the worst periods of my life, but I feel like every single successful person has to go through this rock bottom period in order to make it to where they are at now, similar to me. When I first started trading, I immediately jumped into a live account. I instantly lost all the money that I put into the account because I didn't understand leverage. I didn't understand risk management and I had no strategy whatsoever. I was just like, yeah, stocks go up. So I placed the buy position and then what do you know? Guess what? I ended up actually going down for that day and I ended up losing a whole bunch of money. And just like all of you guys, I'm sure that you guys were brought into day trading for the one reason of, I want to make a ridiculous amount of money and I'm seeing all of these day traders online on YouTube with the cars, the lifestyle, the watches, all of this crazy shit and you're just like, man, I want to be just like them. And I was the same exact way. Maybe you guys are thinking that while watching my blogs or YouTube videos, well, guess what? Newsflash that is actually not what day trading is all about. It can be an awesome buy product of day trading and it can be an awesome reward of day trading but we need to understand the skill of day trading first. And that's where I went wrong for literally the first two years of trying to understand day trading was I would, my one and only goal was to make money. And that is actually the biggest mistake that you guys can make when coming into day trading is just thinking money, money, money. How can I make as much money as possible? Because it will lead you to try and get rich quick. And as we know, getting rich quick, it is literally impossible unless you are the luckiest person on the planet. So these are some of the mistakes that I made when I was first getting into trading. First thing was literally watching every single day trading YouTuber and not even focusing on the technicals, not even focusing on the fundamentals but focusing on their lifestyle. I was like, man, car's so sweet. Man, this dude's making so much money and I wasn't learning anything. So that's the first thing that I'm sure a lot of you guys are getting roped into is you're just like, man, this lifestyle is so cool. I can't wait to start trading. And you guys are completely overlooking the basic and the fundamentals and the technicals of what day trading is all about and what actually led these people to be able to be in the position that they're in today. So that was really the first three months of my day trading career was just watching this edutainment, which is a new form of entertainment nowadays where you guys see people like me, you guys see people that are super successful on all these other side hustles and you're watching their vlogs and you're like, man, these guys are awesome. They're live in the life, but you guys are not focusing on the videos that actually are giving the value to the audience to help them get to where we have gone. And that's exactly what I wanna do this video is to help you guys stay away from all that lifestyle, crazy content and help you guys actually get to where you guys want to go because prior to all of this, I sucked the trading and I was getting into the same shit that you guys were getting into maybe you guys would watch an education video here and there and you guys were like, okay, cool, I'm going to try it out and then you try it out for like five minutes and then you lose all your money and you're like, man, I suck at this. I'm going to go try something else. Well, again, like I was saying, there's no such thing as getting rich quick and that's just the sad reality of life. Success comes from a lot of hard decisions and putting in a lot of hard work and being very disciplined and consistent that stuff that other people aren't willing to do. And in turn, because you're willing to do stuff that other people aren't willing to do, you are going to get results that other people aren't able to have. So when I first started, I was doing the absolute bare minimum and wondering, hey, where are my rewards? I was losing thousands of dollars. I was putting in little to no effort and I really wanted to make it work but I didn't actually realize what I had to do in order to actually make it happen. And that was really the first three to six months of my day trading career was putting in little to no effort and then I came across a video or a book actually by Mark Douglas, which is trading in the zone. And this will help me shift and I highly recommend all you guys go read that book. It changed the way that I looked at trading forever. Essentially, it changed the way that I thought about trading and it actually put things into perspective for me that, okay, I actually have to be consistent. There's a book and there's a movie I think it used to be on Netflix. It's called The Secret. This was talking about the law of attraction and manifestation and I took all of these things to heart so trading in the zone and the secret, law of attraction and manifestation. I took all of this to heart and I actually started putting in work. I started manifesting where I wanted to be in my life and said, man, I want to be like all of these famous and rich day traders that are making a whole bunch of money from trading and I would write down all the steps and all the goals necessary in order for me to be able to get to these end goals. Obviously, I still stuck to trading when I first started writing these things down but I was making progress and that's really where my day trading journey started because prior to that, I was just making mistake after mistake after mistake and I wasn't correcting them because I was just so focused on, hey, I want to make money right before you now. I want to make money today and that is just not how day trading works. You guys have to put in consistent work and consistent and consistent efforts that other people aren't willing to do in order to get results that other people aren't able to achieve because of the work that they've done. So this right here pretty much encapsulates what I was doing within this period and within this first three to six month period, I was losing a whole bunch of money, I was over leveraging, I was over trading and my mindset was shit, I was trading emotionally, I was trading with greed, I was trading with fear because deep down my subconscious, I knew that I wasn't good at the skill of trading and in turn, I would end up cutting my profits too early, I would end up dropping my stop loss and letting my losses run forever because I just wanted the trade to go in my direction and I had no sort of plan in front of me on how I was able to succeed within trading until I actually understood that, hey, this is going to be a long difficult journey and I have to be willing to do the work that other people aren't willing to do. Now, I'm sure a lot of you guys are in the same second position that I was in back when I was getting into trading where I was like, man, I'm at this weird position in my life, I'm about to go into college or for me, I was in high school but I was a junior in high school and I was thinking about college in my future. As you guys know, when you guys are in high school every single person is like, hey, where are you going to go to college? What are you going to do? What are you trying to pursue? What's the major that you're going to go into? And for me, during that time, I was just thinking, I'm going to make a ridiculous amount of money but I don't fucking know how and I don't know what I'm going to tell to these people because college doesn't interest me, working for someone doesn't interest me, I want to be my own boss and I know for a fact that I'm going to be able to do it, I just don't fucking know how and I'm sure a lot of you guys are in that same exact position that I was in where people are asking you these questions deep down you want to tell them, like, I'm going to be freaking millionaire, I'm going to be doing all these things but you say that and they're going to look at you and they're going to point at you and they're going to lap in your face and say, well, yeah, how are you going to do that and you're going to have nothing to tell them? So that was a big turning point for me again where I was like, I don't want to work for anyone. I am approaching college and this is a big turning point in my life and for most of your guys' lives where you guys are going for living with your parents to living on your own and you have to start making your own money on top of that, you have to figure it the fuck out. And this was again, a huge kick start to my trading career where a lot of people were asking me these questions and I was like, fuck it, I gotta get on my shit. So that's really what made me want to start trading and made me want to never give up with this because one, I hated people telling me what to do. That was like literally my least favorite thing ever and it still is to this day. Someone says, you can't do that. I'm immediately thinking and trying to find a way of me to be able to do exactly what they said that I can't do and I'm going to make it happen every single time that's how determined I am and that's how competitive I am. And this was a situation that actually happened with me between my parents. Now obviously they love me and they support me with what I'm doing but at the time, they wanted what was best for me and for me and I'm sure for all of you guys, your parents, they went to high school, they went to college and they got a regular job and that was the way to create wealth back in that day. But now we're in an online era of you're actually going to probably end up finding more success, going off and doing your own thing and starting out and putting in a lot of time and effort into a side hustle to be able to make money online and they just can't really comprehend that and me, I had that vision for myself but they were consistently just telling me, hey, you keep losing all the money in your bank account because we have joined bank accounts at the time in high school. Hey, you keep losing all the money in your bank account. Hey, you keep having overdraft fees from Wells Fargo. They're taking money out of your account because you have a negative balance. Hey, what is going on with you? You're not doing well in school. You're making poor decisions. You need to figure it the fuck out. And deep down, I was like, I'm fucking trying and I know exactly what I want to do. Just give me some fucking time and it caused a little headbutt between myself and my parents where they were like, you're throwing your life away, but deep down, I knew exactly what I was going to become and I'm sure a lot of you guys are going through that as well where your parents are just like, dude, you guys need to get it together. You guys need to actually focus on school, focus on whatever, passing your classes in college so that you guys can get a good education and a good job coming out of college, but deep down, you guys don't want that. And hopefully with this video, I'm able to help you guys be able to get to where you guys want to go before you guys end up clashing with your parents so that you guys can prove them wrong and prove not only to your parents, but also to yourself that this is going to be a sustainable long-term thing. Now, all of this ended up slowly but surely transitioning into a lot of success within trading. Because like I said, hit that turning point in high school where I was like, man, I actually have to figure this out. Time is ticking and I need to be able to, whatever, prove these people wrong and also prove myself right and also be able to support myself financially. Well, I'm going into these new adult years of my life. And when you're first getting into trading, obviously all of the focus is on how can I make as much money as possible. And then you get past that and then you're like, okay, well, if I've been focusing on this for the past six months, this isn't going to help. And then you realize what you actually have to do and you realize that that journey is going to be a lot longer than you thought. Originally, you thought you were going to end up becoming a millionaire in a week, but then you quickly realize after losing hundreds, if not thousands of dollars that that's not going to happen. And then reality sets in. And then you have this long journey of profitability that you have to actually help yourself get through. And in this video, I'm going to help you guys get through that as well and give you guys a step-by-step plan to be able to lead you guys on the straight and narrow path to profitability. But once you guys get through that, it still isn't necessarily all sunshine and rainbows because for me, when I first turned profitable, I was only making whatever like a couple hundred bucks and a couple thousand dollars. But as time goes on, that ends up scaling. And that's the awesome thing with these online side hustles, such as trading, where your potential and your scalability within these businesses and within these online money-making methods is so much larger and far greater than any other nine to five job than any other basic business or any other basic job that you can get yourself into. And the biggest turning point for me was actually sitting myself down at that six month mark and being like, look, this isn't going to be easy. This is going to be very difficult, but I know and I have the resources that are all out here online through YouTube videos like this for you guys, okay, and then at my time, there was YouTube videos and there was books that I was able to read that actually set the record straight of, this is what you have to do in order to get to where you want to go. And that period of time for me was super impactful because I was like, look, I'm just going to put my head down because I have all of these people doubting me, I want to prove them wrong. And also, this is what I want for my life. So once you expand your timeline and understand, okay, this is going to take some time. Not only does it take some time to be able to get to your end goal of becoming a profitable trader, but that timeline never ends because you eventually are going to realize that your life is going to be infinitely scalable. So it's not just scaling from unprofitable to profitable. It goes from unprofitable to profitable to how can I make more money and how can I be more profitable, how can I increase my profits? And that was the second little phase that I went through of understanding, okay, now that I'm making consistent money from the markets, how can I leverage these different software as these different companies within the day trading space to help me make more money? How can I improve my strategy? How can I improve my risk management plan through journaling and understanding what influences to take and what influences I should probably stay away from based on my win rate and based on my risk reward off of each of these influences and off of the strategies that I'm learning. There's infinite ways for you to scale your money in every single business. And that is the hard reality that you guys have to face once you actually end up turning profitable. And once I was able to, again, face that reality, I was like, damn, there's more work to do. And that has led me to be in the position that I'm in today where you guys probably seen me go from, if you guys have been following me for a while, like I'm on social media around three years ago, or almost exactly three years ago, that's been like three years in like a month that have been on social media. But if you guys look back to where I was when I first started social media and look at the day trading profits that I was initially making, it was like a couple thousand dollar days to now where just recently, I was able to make $400,000 in a single day. Again, that's not a typical day for me, but that is the potential that I've been able to get out of myself by continuously working and continuously trying to one scale my capital and two scale my craft within trading to be able to get better. If you guys compare my entries that I'm taking now compared to what entries I was taking two years ago or even just a year ago, it's a drastic difference because I understand, hey, I have to continue getting better at the skill. If I want to one be able to compete with these markets on a daily basis and continue to scale my profits and continue to make money within trading. So again, it's expanding our timeline and understanding that, okay, this isn't just, I'm going to get rich in a month, it's not that. And it's not, I'm just going to get rich once I turn profitable in two years. No, it's not that. It's how can I get rich and make as much money as possible across my entire timeline of life? And that's when the game begins is when you guys are able to sit yourself down and realize I have to put in hard work and I have to be disciplined and I have to be motivated every single day in order to be able to get all of these awesome rewards. And that is not only what causes people to stay away from being profitable, but also by 98% of traders and 99% of people aren't able to get in that 1% tax bracket. It's the 1% tax bracket for a reason because that 1% is willing to do things that 99% of people aren't willing to do. They're willing to wake up early, they're willing to put in work every single day versus other people, they aren't willing to do that. So they stick to their comfortable yet what they deem difficult and hard and not the best life. Me personally, I would rather put myself in an uncomfortable position every single day so that I can live the life of my dreams. And I hope that you guys are willing to do that too. So with that being said, let's get into the three pillars of trading that can help you guys scale not only your trading, but also your life to these awesome levels that I've been able to achieve and I know that you guys are able to too. So within trading, just like any other skill, believe it or not, in order to get good at it, you really just have to master the three fundamentals and the three fundamentals of trading. You need all three of them in a return profitable. The first one is going to be psychology. The second one is going to be risk management. And the third one is going to be strategy. I promise you, I promise you, I promise you, it's not going to be what broker you choose. I promise you, it's not going to be what trade journaling you use. I promise you, it's not going to be whether you're looking at trading view with a razor mouse or not. I promise you, it's not the trading setup that you have. I promise you, it's not the number of monitors that you guys have within your trading setup. And I promise you, it's not the number of pairs that you guys look at. All of those are like 0.01% things within trading that a lot of people like to focus on because they're avoiding the hard work that's in front of them. Because these three pillars, these three fundamentals, these three skills, they're very difficult to grow. But if you guys are willing to stick to them and are willing to master these three fundamentals, you guys would be able to master trading. It's just like any other skill, embassable. Let's think about the best players in the world. They're not the best players in the world because they know how to do between the legs, behind the back, reverse layup off the glass. They're the best players in the world because they're really freaking good at dribbling, they're really freaking good at passing and they're really freaking good at putting the ball on the hoop and they have a good basketball IQ. It's the same exact thing with trading. If we can just simplify this down to three fundamental skills and master these skills, then we are going to find success. So the first skill that I want to introduce is going to be psychology. Psychology is by far one of the most important skills within trading and it is what typically holds a lot of traders back. Risk management and strategy are pretty straightforward and I'm sure you guys already are like, yeah, I already know how to trade with a good strategy. I already know what a risk management plan is, but psychology is where everybody fucks up and psychology is specifically what made me fuck up for that first three to six months of my unprofitable journey where I was thinking, I just want to get rich as fast as possible. When I go into the market thinking like that, I'm going to end up making bad decisions and I'm going to end up making emotional decisions with my money within the market. So within these three pillars, there's a couple of dumb skills that you guys can learn to grow and I'm going to make them seem rather simple within this but they're not or it's simple, but it's difficult to stick to. So the first part of trading with psychology, building your trading psychology is just trading with logic. Again, we are naturally emotionally connected and tied to money within life, okay, because money puts food on the table, money gives us shelter, money literally, it just makes the world go round and it's what keeps us alive. Realistically, it's what keeps us alive, it helps us pay for water, helps us pay for food and puts a bed underneath us when we need to go to sleep. Okay, so the unfortunate thing with trading is that there is a direct correlation of being successful in trading and making money and being unsuccessful in trading and losing money versus other businesses and other side hustles, there's not necessarily that direct correlation, there is a correlation but it's not as direct as trading because in trading, when you press the buy button and price ends up going down and you lose money on that trade, you're like, that I'm unsuccessful because I lost money and we need to fully detach ourselves from that. Instead of thinking how can I make money in the markets, we need to be thinking how can I predict where price wants to go, the high probability on a daily basis. I'm sure you guys have heard me say this over and over and over again in a lot of my videos but it is 100% true. You guys need to be able to predict where price wants to go on a high probability on a daily basis. That is what leads to making money in the market and being successful within trading. So how do we do that? We trade with logic and trade with the data that is given to us. We aren't trading with emotions, we aren't trading on, oh, I wanna make more money so I'm going to move might take profit a little bit higher so I can make more. No, we're not doing that. We're taking profit because price just hit an area where price could potentially reverse off of this. We are predicting where price wants to go with a high probability. On top of that, we're not entering into a trade because I need to make money today. I need to pay my rent. I need to be able to eat today. And again, a lot of you guys may be in that situation and if that's the case, you guys need to get a real job so you guys can support yourselves while you guys are trying to learn this skill. We need to focus on being data driven when it comes to trading and I know this sounds simple but it's very difficult because once we start trading with real money, we get right back into that emotional phase of, I wish I made more money today or I didn't take this trade and if I did, I would have made money today. We need to fully detach our heads base from that and just focus on how can I predict what the high probability where price wants to go by trading based off the data that's given to us not based off of how we feel, not based off of our emotions. We need to be trading based on what the charts are telling us and I have a whole bunch of different strategy videos and compliments videos that you guys can watch on how to understand price action and how to determine where price is going to go consistently. Okay, you guys can go watch those YouTube videos but we need to be trading based on that data that's given to us and not the data that's in our head or the emotions that are in our head that are causing us to make poor decisions within the market. The next thing within psychology is making sure that our trades stay consistent. So again, this was a big issue that I went through and I'm sure that a lot of you guys went through when you guys are learning how to trade. You guys are jumping from strategy to strategy. You guys will try one strategy and then you guys are like, well, I lost one trade so this strategy clearly doesn't work. Well, new splash, no strategies are going to give you guys a 100% win rate and on top of that, if it was as easy as just going in grabbing a strategy off the internet and saying, okay, cool, I just have to follow these five steps and then I'll be profitable every single person in the world would be rich and we know that that is not the case and we also know that 98% of traders, they end up failing and on top of that, they actually don't end up failing, they end up giving up. So if trading was as easy as just grabbing a strategy, trading it and then making money because you have found a strategy off the internet, every single person would be rich. So it's not as simple as going and just grabbing a strategy and then trying it out one day and then if it doesn't work, oh, guess this person was a liar, guess this person was a fake guru onto the next one. No, that's not the case. We need to and again, strategies, one of our three pillars, it's literally one of our main pillars of being able to be good at trading. We can't be hopping from strategy to strategy. We need to find one strategy that makes sense in our head for why price is going to move. Again, what are we trying to do? We're trying to trade with logic. So if we can understand why price is moving, why price is reacting off of certain confluences on the chart, then what is that gives us the ability to do? Trade with logic. And on top of that, when we have a consistent trading strategy and when we have consistent confluences and understand why price wants to move off of these confluences, it's going to help us detach from that emotional connection to money. Why? Because we're going to be trading off of data rather than emotions. Last but not least, you guys need to find a way to be nonchalant within trading. And this is something that was so freaking difficult for me. And again, goes back to that emotional connection to money because when you guys are uncropable and you guys are trying to learn how to trade, more often than not, we are not in good financial situations. We probably have a job that we hate. And we think trading is going to help us get out of that job. It can get you out of that job, but it's going to be a lot harder and a lot more difficult than you guys. And one of those issues that I faced within that first three to six months of trying to make trading work was I wanted it to happen far quicker than what reality actually had in store for me. And because of that, whenever I lose a trade, I'll get very emotional and I'll get really upset. And I'll take every single one of those losses to heart. Now, when you end up doing that, what do you end up doing? You end up revenge trading. You end up placing more risk on your next trade to be able to make up for the loss that you took on that trade because you're mad about. And then what do you end up doing? You end up trading with your emotions. Not with your edge, not with your strategy, and then you're boom, right back to square one, trading with emotions rather than logic. So my advice to you guys is build the skill in the competence of being a profitable trader before you guys end up actually going and risking any money. There's so many tools and so many different softwares and brokerages out there on the internet. I have a broker that I use consistently on a daily basis. You guys can check it out in the link in the description if you guys want. So these softwares and these brokerages actually give you guys the ability to be able to trade with fake money. So in turn, instead of getting really upset about the loss, you won't be upset about the loss because you didn't lose any money. OK, and this is one of the most powerful tools that you guys can use when trying to build the skill of day trading. Again, it's not going to be exciting because guess what, you're not making money and you're not losing any money. But again, like I was saying at the beginning of this video, we need to expand our timelines on where we want to go with trading. We need to understand that right now, we are willing to put ourselves through a bunch of hard work and a bunch of discipline and a bunch of whatever day to day consistent actions that are going to help us change our lives forever. So if we think about this small period of time that we're willing to give up trying to get rich quick, trying to make as much money as possible within the small little window period and understand that, hey, this skill is actually going to take a little bit of time in order for us to be able to turn profitable and be able to change our lives. But that little bit of time on the grand scheme of our massive timeline of life is just going to be a small blip. And if we're able to dedicate that small blip of time in order to change our lives, then the rest of our timeline of life looks so much different than what it would be if we just don't do any of these actions. So I strongly advise you guys to trade on a paper or a demo trading account. So you guys can again detach yourselves from that emotion of trying to make money within trading. And in turn, that is going to help you guys become nonchalant within trading because you guys are not going to be affected by the losses that you take. And in turn, you guys are going to be more willing to learn from those losses instead of taking emotional action following the loss. So imagine this, I lose money on a real account. How am I going to feel? I'm going to be really pissed off because of dead broke and I didn't want to lose money for that day. I'm going to be mad because I wanted trading to make me rich quick and in turn, what did it make me do? It made me broke faster. OK, it actually made me like poor quicker rather than rich quicker. And I'm going to end up taking horrible actions following that versus if I lose money on a fake trading account, one, I'm not going to be upset because I lost money. Two, I'm actually going to be able to learn from that loss and be able to get in and digest that loss and say, OK, what did I do wrong? I'm not going to be upset because I didn't lose any real money. And I'm going to be able to actually study that loss and turn that loss and turn that mistake into growth. And that is what's going to help you guys turn into a profitable trader by detaching the emotional connection to money. And it's one of the most difficult skills that you guys need to learn, which is psychology. But that is the first pillar of trading that you guys need to learn in order to find success within trading. Moving on to the second pillar in this kind of coincides with psychology, this is risk management. So again, once we understand that, hey, we shouldn't be trading with our emotions. And when we're trading emotionally, we're probably going to be risking far more than our risk profile is willing to give us. And on top of that, when we're trading based off of logic and based off of data, we know that we can't be risking our entire account per trade because we know that no day trader is going to have a 100% win rate. So this is a very key pillar not only to be able to preserve our capital, but to be able to help us trade for the rest of our lives. And on top of that, just like how I was saying earlier in this video, to be able to scale once we do turn profitable, to be able to find different ways to be able to maximize our wins and minimize our losses. And that is risk management. It's a super important skill. So let's get into it. First and foremost, we need to drop our bad habits. This is super similar psychology. These things are going to slow you guys down and hold you guys back from your guys' progress. Risk management is one of the biggest keys. And the biggest bad habit that I see people do is when there are trading on a live account and they haven't built up the skills and they haven't built up the confidence that they need in order to be a profitable trader. And they're trading on a live account and they lose money and they are like, man, I want to make that money back because I needed it to be able to pay for rent, to be able to pay for my food, and then in turn, what do they do? They end up risking a little bit more on another trade that they shouldn't be taking in the first place and then it's an endless cycle of lose money, lose money, lose more money, and then eventually lose your whole account. These are bad habits. This is bad risk management. How can we get over this by building out a risk management plan? We need to create a trading plan. This trading plan is going to help us eliminate our bad habits and start reinforcing new good habits that will directly translate into your guys' success of trading. Okay, so when we have bad habits, their habits, okay? So we understand that, hey, we consistently do these things over and over again. But if we can put in our heads and maybe put down into our manifestation or law of attraction journal, just like I did back in the day, this journal back when I was an unprofitable trader, I'll literally read you guys through some of the things that I would say every single day, we'll skip over the, I will be a millionaire and I will own a Lamborghini entries here. But this is what I would write down, literally every single day and say, I'll out. I will take good trades. I will see good setups. I will be patient. I will be patient. I will be patient. I had an issue with patients. And then from there, I wrote out my entire trading strategy of saying like, I will only look at the four hour, one hour daily time frames all of this. On top of that, I said, I will trade with no emotion. I will grow my trading account to X amount. I will hit my daily goals. I will keep a positive mindset. I will read these goals daily. So by me reading through this on a daily basis, not only did it bring those bad habits to light every single morning because I was writing them down and I was saying them out loud, but I was also trying to build these new good habits that can replace bad habits. Okay, habits are habits. There's good ones and there's bad ones. But regardless, we have good habits that we do every single day and we have bad habits that we do every single day. A habit needs to be replaced with a new one. So right now, a lot of you guys have bad habits within trading. We are going to be able to remove those and replace them with good ones. But you guys have to be willing and able to know that, hey, this is going to be difficult to be able to change this bad habit out for a new good one. And I can't remember the amount of days, but I believe it takes 21 days to be able to break a bad habit, which again, it's actually not that long. It's literally three weeks, okay? It takes 21 days to break a bad habit in 90 days to replace it with a new good one and to have that good habit actually turn into a real habit. So the goal should be break those bad habits for 21 days and while we're breaking those bad habits, we replace them with the new ones and then keep consistently with discipline working on those good habits to eventually be able to turn into what a profitable trader. By reinforcing those good habits, we are going to help ourselves be able to stick to our risk management plan, be able to stick to our trading plan and be able to stick to our good psychology to not make emotional decisions within the market. And then last but not least, you guys need to be disciplined. So none of this ends up working within psychology, within risk management, within our trading plan, unless we are disciplined. You guys need to be disciplined in order to be able to place smart trades and to be able to one, break those bad habits, to be able to replace them with good habits and three, be able to emotionally detach ourselves from the money within trading, which is pretty much all of what psychology is. All of psychology can be boiled down into just being disciplined. And when you feel those emotions arise, where you're like, holy shit, I just want to, oh, I just want to make all this money back right now and I should have made money on this trade. I was right about this or, oh no, I'm scared that I'm going to miss out on this trade because it's going higher and higher and higher. We know the end result that comes out of all of those emotions. It's always fucking bad. When in your entire life, have you seen a trade that you're like, oh my gosh, it keeps going higher and higher. I just need to buy right now and then you buy in the boom, it just goes in the opposite direction and then you end up losing money. When have any of these emotional decisions led you guys to a good reward or to something that's beneficial? Never, ever, ever in your entire life. So in order to stick to these, we have to have the discipline to be able to say no to these emotions and to be able to stick to these trading and risk management plans that we've built out for ourselves. Now, let's get into the last pillar, which is going to be strategy. Pillar number three, what every single trader loves and strives to learn the most about is going to be trading strategy. Now, keep in mind, this is very important, but a lot of you guys end up putting more importance on trading strategy than you guys do on risk management and psychology and that is why you guys are unsuccessful within the markets. I'm sure almost 80% if not 90% of the day trading videos of the day trading videos that you guys have watched so far have been purely focused on understanding chart work, understanding confluences, understanding, price action, trying to figure out where price wants to go and you guys are thinking that this right here is going to be your golden ticket out of trading. And while that is partially true, imagine I'm a trader that has a high probability of predicting where price action wants to go on a daily basis. This is what strategy helps us do. And I get into the market and I have an 80% win rate. It's really good. I've an 80% win rate, but I have bad psychology and I have bad risk management. I get into the market, I place my first trade and I end up losing. It's part of that, 20% of the losing win rate that I have. A disciplined and a profitable trader with good psychology and good risk management would, one, if that's their total risk allotment for the day, would call it a day and they would be off the charts and they would be done for that day. Somebody that just has trading strategy without psychology and without a risk management plan will fall into their emotions and they will take another trade that doesn't follow their strategy because now they're falling into their emotions, they're going to take a trade because they're angry because they're greedy because they want to make money for the day because they don't actually have a risk management plan and their risk management plan or they don't even have one, doesn't even say that they're not allowed to take more trades for that day. So they ended up taking another trade, not based off the strategy that they have but based off the emotions that they have and in turn, what does that cause them to do? Take a losing trade and on top of that, what will that likely cause them to lead and spiral down into losing their entire account because they don't have risk management and they don't have the psychological discipline to be able to stick to their trading strategy. That's why we need to master all three of these pillars. Every single one of you guys, I can tell you without a doubt, what's way too much emphasis on trading strategy rather than psychology, risk management and strategy together. A lot of you guys can really benefit from trying to master discipline, master your emotions within trading and figure out a good risk management plan so that you guys can minimize your losses, maximize your wins and help you got scale within profitability. Strategy for most traders is the least of their worries. Why? Because it's the easiest thing to learn, okay? A lot of people will go and watch a YouTube video and it's pretty fundamental. It's super simple. Hey, we wait for a liquidity sweep and then we wait for a break of structure and then we wait for a fair value gap to get filled and we scale down and we look for an entry, we enter and then we target new lows or new highs and then we take profit. It's pretty simple, it's pretty mechanical and it's relatively easy to learn and understand. The most difficult skills to be able to build and to be able to learn are the two that I covered before this and that's why we put them first. Because a lot of you guys, if anything, are over educating yourselves on trading strategy rather than psychology and risk management. And that's what's leading me into this point right here, which is my offer to you guys, what I've helped literally thousands of other students do, which is help them not only understand strategy because I'm really, really freaking good at making predictions of where price wants to go with a high probability on a daily basis. But just like how I discussed earlier in this video, we need those other two skill sets to be able to perform within the markets. And if you guys are struggling with building those two skill sets and it's difficult to articulate and hopefully I've helped you guys within this video to be able to build those skill sets, then what I want to be able to do for you guys is because you guys are probably overeducated on trading strategy, which you guys are undereducated on psychology and risk management is I want to be able to help you guys get to where you guys want to go. Just like within this video, we've been laying out a straight and narrow path towards profitability. I want to be able to fast track your guys' path to profitability through actual mentorship and prerecorded videos that actually go over all of these concepts to be able to help you guys get to where you guys want to go. Pre-recorded videos, that's one thing. You guys can find any and all of that information on YouTube. What you guys can't find on YouTube is the 10,000 plus hours that I and other profitable coaches put into the markets where we've made mistakes that you guys are making that are super individualized, that are super personal to you, that you guys don't know how to solve, and that we are going to be able to solve them for you guys by getting on coaching calls with you guys, by interacting with you guys in the chat. You guys will literally be able to talk to us on a coaching call and just say, Hey, man, I'm struggling with this or I took this straight off of this and then this happened. I ended up losing, but I thought I followed the strategy correctly and we'll be able to say, Hey, look, you actually did everything right, but you missed out on this thing right here and then boom, that problem solved and you guys are instantly going to be able to grow. Versus if you guys try and do this on your own and you guys are going to be making psychological risk management and strategy mistakes that you guys may not even think that you guys are making because of the way that you guys digested the content on YouTube. You guys think that everything you're doing is correct. When in fact, you guys may be doing every single thing incorrectly and that's why these coaching calls are so beneficial and that's why having a mentor is so beneficial is because when you guys are able to actually come to somebody that has proven profitability within the markets just like I have by showing you guys literally when I enter, when I exit every single day and showing you guys P&L, like that is proof of profitability and you guys being able to come to me and say, Hey, I have this issue within my trading and I make this mistake whatever, over and over and over again and I can be like, Look, that's actually not a mistake. You're doing that correctly, but you're actually doing this thing right here incorrectly that you thought you've been doing correctly for your entire career of trading and that's the issue that you need to fix. That information is not online for free. That information can only come from a mentor and can only come from a coach who has been in your guys' shoes before and has been through that unprofitable route that you guys are trying to get towards profitability and that is where I can be the biggest service to you guys because these questions and these lessons and mistakes that you guys are making, we can't put them into a YouTube video not because I don't want to but because every single one of you guys is going to be making different mistakes and is going to have different lessons that you guys need to learn that are personalized to you that are very specific and very advanced that are going to take solutions that aren't necessarily going to be covered on a YouTube video. Maybe one or two of those mistakes that you guys have been looking for, a solution for for the past six months, you end up finding a little gem within a YouTube video and then boom, you guys got it and there's a slight room for growth but then you guys are on the hunt for that next YouTube video that's going to be able to solve the next problem and the next mistake to be able to get to that next level to be able to help you guys get closer to profitability and that's a problem by doing this on your own it makes your path a lot longer and a lot more difficult and when you have somebody that's been through those mistakes before that knows all the solutions that you guys are going through and knows the solutions to the mistakes and the lessons that you guys need to learn you guys are going to be able to fast track your guys is path to profitability and that's what I want to help you guys do where yeah, I'm sure a lot of you guys already know trading strategy to what you guys think to a fucking tee but you guys may be marking influences incorrectly you guys may be marking out or taking trades often confluences and price action that you get shouldn't be taking and you guys think you're doing it correct but then when you come to us as mentors and coaches and you guys say, hey, this is what I've been doing I'm doing everything right I don't know where I'm going wrong and we're like, bro, you've been doing everything wrong this entire time you guys won't be able to find that in a YouTube video because what you guys perceive as what you're following that YouTube video to a tee you guys are actually doing it incorrectly and that's why having a mentor and that's why having a coach is so important within your path to profitability is because we're able to actually highlight your guys' mistakes and you guys are able to come to us with your mistakes and we're going to be able to give you a solution to every single one of those mistakes so that you guys can speed run your path to profitability but this sounds interesting to you guys you guys can click the link down in the description to be able to be mentored by me and a bunch of other profitable coaches it's literally one of the best programs within the day trading space we have far more results than any other mentor and there's a reason why I have so many subscribers on here and so many followers on Instagram so many followers on TikTok it's because I help traders just like you guys get to where you guys want to go within trading okay so that's the first part of strategy is just having a mentor and having somebody that has been in your guys' position before to be able to help you guys scale to where you guys want to go to be able to get over those little mistakes that we can't articulate on YouTube videos because they're personalized to you number two is understanding that fundamentals and less is more I'm sure a lot of you guys came across YouTube video after YouTube video and this is part of that over education where you guys are like man I wish that there's going to be one secret key that's going to help me boom just break through and turn profitable and trading and I know that there's one specific confluence or one specific part of the strategy that I'm missing it's not it's focusing on the three pillars of trading and the most frequently asked question to me as a mentor and as a coach is TJR what's the one thing that you heard or what's the one thing that you learned that just helped trading click and once you learned it you turn profitable you guys are on the edge of your seat right now there's no such thing the thing that makes trading click is getting 1% better every single day by working on your psychology by maximizing your risk management plan by focusing on your trading strategy and sticking to it by sticking to your risk management plan by not falling into emotions and by replacing those bad habits with good habits every single day that is what makes trading click and it doesn't make it click instantly it's over a long period of time and that's the sad reality of trading I'm sorry if I broke your heart today honey but guess what that's the sad reality of trading and that is what's going to help you guys be able to get to where you guys want to go it's just literally stripping that down and saying guess what you're not going to get rich click from trading but on the massive timeline of your life and you promise you you're going to get rich a lot faster than anybody else trying to do anything else by dedicating your life and a small period of your life to the scale to be able to scale to where you guys want to go and focusing and understanding that less is more within trading more you guys look and the more you guys dig the more over analyzing you guys are going to do more analysis paralysis you guys are going to have and it's just going to be really difficult for you guys to be able to scale to be able to get to where you guys want to go within trading focus on the fundamentals find a strategy that works for you find confluences that makes sense to you and stick to it and work on them every single day focus on discipline focus on detaching yourself from emotions focus on sticking to your risk management plan and stick to a strategy that makes sense to you that helps you guys predict a price action wants to go on a daily basis with a high probability and that is how you guys are able to copy me in order to turn into a profitable trader it's a long and it's a very difficult road but I promise you guys if you guys are able to stick to it and if you guys can understand these three pillars of trading and work your ass up every single day to be able to get over these emotions to be able to focus on your risk management plan and to be able to find a strategy in an edge on the market that helps you predict price action with a high probability you guys will be successful and with that being said, I love and appreciate you guys drop a sub if you guys haven't already, peace out.

=== VIDEO 2/34 : 6 Years Of Trading Knowledge In 20 Minutes-qJap-CZoV6g.txt
============================================

It took me six years to be able to figure all of this out and I'm going to give it to you guys in under 30 minutes. My name is Tyler, everybody online knows me as TJR. I went from being a broke college student to now a full-time day trader and these are a whole bunch of lessons that I wish I knew when I was getting into day trading that literally would have saved me so much freaking time to end up going from that unprofitable to that profitable stage within literally 30 minutes. So hopefully this video can help you guys smooth over and get a clear and narrow path on what you guys should be doing especially when getting into trading and even if you guys are an advanced trader I'm sure that there's something that you guys will be able to grab from this video that you guys are probably doing that is affecting your guys' journey and probably putting a stop on you guys turning from unprofitable to profitable. So with that being said let's get right in there are three main skills within trading that you guys have to master in order to become profitable and believe it or not if you guys just focus on these three fundamentals and get really fucking good at them that's really all you need in order to turn into a profitable trader. So what are these three skills I'm going to break them down one by one and then I'm going to add a couple more tips that we're going to help you guys out but the three skills that you guys need to focus on and we're deterred profitable and it's not any of this like 1% things like figuring out what type of basketball you're supposed to wear that's not going to make you better at basketball doing the fundamentals is going to make you better at basketball and it's the same thing with trading. So what are the three skills that you need to get really freaking good at in order to become profitable you need to master your mindset, your psychology, your risk management and then your strategy all three of these are equally as important in order for you guys to turn into a profitable trader. A lot of people over educate themselves on the strategy side of things and that's going to be one of the easiest things for you guys to learn because literally every single YouTube video that you guys see online is telling you some new and improved strategy on how you guys can make whatever $5,000 in two minutes and then turn profitable but what a lot of people abandon is mindset and risk management and that is equally as important if not even more important due to the over education that we have on strategy what trying to turn into a profitable trader. So now that we know the three fundamentals let's get into each one of them and break down how you guys can actually build these skills so that you guys can turn into a profitable trader much faster than the majority of these other people. So let's start off with mindset that's one of our three skill sets that we need to master in order to become a profitable trader. This is probably the hardest skill set to master because unfortunately us as humans we have a very strong emotional attachment to money. We think about every single dollar transaction it hurts us to be able to make those payments. It hurts us to be able to lose money and then we get super excited when we make money okay and this is what we need to avoid feeling when we're in the markets or else if we are feeling sad when we lose money and we're feeling excited when we win money we might as well go to the casino and gamble that money instead and honestly your probability is probably a little bit higher if you're gambling and feeling those emotional swings then if you were to do a trading because trading you can lose a lot of money really quick same thing with gambling but if we treat this like a casino it is going to end up like a casino where the house is going to win the brokerage is just going to take your hard earned money and take into the bank and say ha ha you are part of the 98% of traders that fail so the first thing that we need to do is break that emotional connection that we have with money. This is one of the most difficult things for us to do because especially as beginner traders we are starting out with low capital. How can we try and at least break that emotional connection to money? Well the first thing is starting off by trading on a demo account or a paper trading account most brokerages have these things that allow you guys to build the skill set of trading without having to risk your own money but you're obviously wanting to turn into a profitable trader making real money from trading so obviously we're going to have to eventually transition from trading on demo and fake money over to real money but the best thing that you guys can do is start off with demo and fake money so that you guys can build the skill set of being a profitable trader so that when you do move to real money you're still going to have some emotions tied to the money but at least you'll have the confidence to take the trades that you're supposed to because you have the skill set of trading so one we need to establish the skill set of trading and that's going to be helped through risk management and strategy so quite establishing these two fundamentals we're actually going to be helping this fundamental of mindset. We're going to get to those two fundamentals later on in this video but again we need to establish that through demo and paper trading before we actually move into live trading and then once we move into live trading that's when these emotions may come back we have the fear of losing money we have the greed of wanting to make more money so how can we get over these things this is something that is again it's really difficult and it's really hard for me to articulate but one of the easiest things that I can say is don't trade with money that you aren't willing to lose I remember back when I was an unprofitable trader I was pretty much dumping my entire bank account into these live accounts because I was like hey I just need to full port and then if I hit one or two trades boom I like two or three X my bank account and the problem with that is you get really greedy and then also you're trading with money that you can't lose you can't afford to lose your rent is on the line your food for that night is on the line I know it's easy for me to say as somebody that's in a financially you know safe position and you guys are not necessarily in the same financial situation as I am but trust me when I say this build up a trading account balance and like save money stash money on the side so that when you guys are working these side jobs that you guys are using to support your life you guys are taking money out and sashing it to the side to the point where this money on the side it's not going to affect you necessarily if you guys are going to lose money or make money on it because you're already paying your bills with your current job okay you guys need to think about it like that you should not be risking money that you can't afford to lose or think hey I'm going to go into this trading thing and I'm going to pay my rent with this no because you guys haven't even established that you guys are good at the skill set yet if you guys are working to nine five I know you guys aren't making too much money that's okay slowly but surely keep stashing money away and guess what while you're doing this you guys can be trading on a demo account on a fake money account on a paper trading account so that you guys can build that confidence and build that skill set of trading to the point where once that little safety reserve once that little stash of money that you guys have been putting away for a while is built up to a solid amount you guys have one built the skill set of trading but also you guys have built up a good balance for you to go into a live account with to the point where you understand that hey it's okay if I lose all this money why because the work that I'm doing it still pays the bills and two I know that this money is something that I'm willing to risk in order to potentially change my life and guess what if you lose all that money no harm no foul why because it's a lesson learned and it's a mistake that you guys can grow from so again there was countless times where I lost literally my entire bank account when trying to trade but the biggest thing for you guys is being able to build that skill set of trading while you guys are stashing money on the side and understand that this money that you're stashing on the side is going to be a tool to help you guys get to where you want to go until you guys get to the point where you are consistently getting withdraws consistently getting payouts from funded accounts the money on the side is not supposed to support you financially and that's where a lot of people fuck up is they get into trading because they think it's going to get them rich in a month and if you guys have that mindset you guys are going to crash out immediately and you guys are going to lose everything immediately because that's greed okay and if you're trading with money that you can't afford to lose then you're going to be trading with fear and those are honestly the two biggest emotions that traders struggle with because they aren't handling their finances correctly and a lot of mindset just purely comes to lack of financial responsibility on the trader side of things because they're trying to make it happen in a split second when if you guys just focus on building the skill of trading while slowly stashing money away to potentially change your life while also supporting yourself financially from your regular job you're going to be able to get there a lot quicker and this was something that I wish I had learned when I was an unprofitable trader trying to turn profitable because again I was not smart with my money and I was pretty much throwing hard earned money that was supposed to support my life I was supposed to pay for rent that was supposed to pay for food and I was spending it on these accounts because I was like hey by doing this I'm going to get rich quick and then boom I'll be able to make three times my rent I'll be able to pay my rent and then I'll also be able to go buy a Louis bill and guess what every single time you do that you're dealing with money that you can't afford to lose that you need to make money on and then boom you're screwed because you're trading with fear or you're trading with greed so be able to identify those two emotions if you guys are ever feeling like hey when I'm in a trade I'm scared of losing you're trading with too much money if you're ever in a trade and you get excited when you win or if you get excited when the trade is going in your direction you are trading with too much money and you're trading with money that you can't afford and you're much better off lowering your account size to a point where you need to be able to build that emotionless relationship with money and this is what a lot of business owners and a lot of successful people now have with money where we see it as a tool rather than a necessity so think about the money that you're stashing away as a tool to get you to where you want to go and make sure all of your regular living expenses are covered and that will help you guys build that emotionless connection to money now with that being said let's move on to risk management and this is also going to be dealing with money just like I was mentioning in the mindset portion in the psychology portion risk management is super important and again a lot of people get into trading and are just thinking about the big wins and how excited they would be if they were able to hit like a $50,000 win that's the problem if you're getting excited about a win like you guys see my trade recaps where I'm making a hundred thousand dollars in a trade or like $25,000 in a trade and I'm emotionless throughout all of it even sometimes I'll lose $25,000 or I'll lose $50,000 and I'm emotionless through all of it so you guys need to be thinking okay what amount of money is that going to amount to me and that's how you guys should initially treat your risk management where you guys shouldn't be getting excited about the wins you guys shouldn't be getting sad about the losses ideally when it comes to risk management you guys are going to be risking anywhere from like one to three percent of your trading account per trade but again going back to that mindset point where if your account is with money that you can't afford to lose and you guys are risking one to three percent of that account and that one to three percent of that account is money that you can't afford to lose you are still going to be feeling those emotions because risk management is two things okay it's risking the right amount per trade but it's also understanding that hey we need to be risking the amount to the point where we are still emotionless with the money that we're trading on top of that we need to be trading to be able to trade another day the way that I like to think about this is understand that losing weeks are going to come losing days are going to come and if you're risking too much of your account to the point where it's going to drastically affect your account balance when you guys are losing these trades or winning these trades a lot of people think like yeah if I get a big win that's going to be beneficial no and trust me coming from me I turned an account from $10,000 into $112,000 and you're probably thinking wow that was great no because it reinforced bad habits for me and guess what happened the very next day I lost all of it because I was risking the same amount and I was doing that same really crazy really dumb risk that I was doing in the past that helped get me from $10,000 to $112,000 over the course of two days and then in turn what happened I ended up losing all of it the following day so again we need to be thinking with our account balances how can we live to trade another day and how can we make this account last for our entire timeline of being a full-time profitable trader and I know you guys are probably dealing with smaller account balances right now but with that mindset of like how can I leverage this account size and use this account size to my advantage to the point where okay I'm trading with one a dollar amount that I'm not afraid to lose and I'm not excited about whatever the profit that I'm going to get on it and then also I'm risking an amount where it's not going to drastically affect my account balance if I lose and it's also not going to drastically affect my account balance if I win those are two very important things and by risking one to three percent of your account that's going to help you guys live to trade another day now let's get into the third skill set which is going to be strategy now I'm honestly not going to go too deep into this I have a free course that you guys can learn literally every single conference that I ever teach online I'll leave a link in the description for that where you guys can learn all of that I also teach people directly as students okay if you guys want to be mentored by me personally and a bunch of other profitable traders as your guys as coach if you guys want like specific answers to your guys as questions because again when I'm making these YouTube videos it's like one thing for me to get on here and just kind of make a vague assumption of what all you know unprofitable traders are going through but some of you guys may have specific questions that you guys want to ask me personally or another profitable trader coach personally and that's what we give you guys access to in my blueprint so I'll leave a little link down in the description for that but again a lot of that can be solved with just these YouTube videos so let's get into strategy strategy I really don't want to cover it too much because like I said it's the over educated part of day trading where a lot of people already know their strategy but one thing that I do want to cover is the over education of strategies so a lot of you guys are watching multiple strategy videos per day you guys are watching multiple conferences videos per day and you guys are just looking for some secret key some magic key some magic confluence that you guys are going to learn one day via YouTube and that boom that's just going to change the trading game for you news flash that is not going to happen and it's never going to happen and if you keep looking for it you guys will never turn profitable and this was a mistake that I made when I was trying to turn profitable where I was just watching endless endless endless content on YouTube versus if I had just stuck to the strategy that was somewhat working for me or stuck to the confluence is that I understood why price was moving off of them and then just completely turned off all of day trading YouTube and stopped looking for conferences that were going to help my strategy get a 50% better win rate like fuck all of that the best experience that you guys are going to gain when it comes to strategy is actually applying it to the markets so instead of spending hours on YouTube trying to learn the next best strategy or the next S confluence that's going to help you guys become a profitable trader you guys probably have already digested thousands of hours worth of strategy content on YouTube you guys no longer need strategy content you guys need to apply it it's like the difference or the analogy of someone that sits down and watches 1000 hours worth of basketball training videos versus somebody that spends a thousand hours without knowing anything about basketball just on the basketball court once we put those people on the court at the end of both of those durations who's going to be better at basketball when we give the person who's never touched basketball in their life but watch 1000 hours worth of basketball training videos guess what there's still going to fucking suck yes they may know like certain drills or certain moves that may help them but they don't know how to fucking dribble they don't know how to fucking shoot and it's going to be their first time attempting to do these things versus if we give someone a ball and have them actually try and train for a thousand hours they're going to be in a far better position than the person that just sat there and watched so it's the same exact thing with trading we need to actually be building this skill set how by fucking trading okay you wonder how you get better at trading by putting in repetitions it's just like the gym you need to go into the gym every single day to build those muscles to build that muscle memory of actually trading and getting better at it okay there's several different softwares that can help you guys back test there's trading view obviously that's how we actually like can practice live trading there's demo there's paper trading accounts that you guys can actually be placing these trades and then figuring out how you guys can get better in real time in these markets okay because again it's one thing to be watching these videos and understanding the confluence is but it's another thing to actually go out there and apply it you guys need to be doing both and if anything I'm sure you guys have already watched too many of these YouTube videos so you guys might as well start putting in more work on trading view rather than on YouTube the last little tip and thing that I want to cover in this video is just understanding that everyone's timeline is going to be different okay and I'm sure you guys can like follow a whole bunch of day traders including myself whether it be on YouTube TikTok or Instagram and a lot of social media is just highlighting the wins in fact it's really annoying for me because I try and be super transparent about all my wins and all my losses but even on YouTube if you guys scroll through all of my trade recaps guess what videos get more views it's the days that I'm winning the days that I'm making $150,000 in a day the days that I'm making $25,000 in a day just recently trade recap I made $22,000 in a day that video got 45,000 45,000 more views than me losing $25,000 in a day the balances were the exact same except people just wanted to watch the win way more than they wanted to watch the loss when in fact if they had watched the losses they would probably be learning more because it's a mistake that they're meant to or made and it was a mistake that they probably made on that trading day as well unfortunately in this social media era that we're in a lot of the wins are highlighted instead of the losses and again like I said I like to be super transparent with you guys but you sometimes have to do your digging to be able to find these things because again the wins are just highlighted far more than the losses especially when it comes to being an unprofitable trader that's something that can be super discouraging because you guys see all these traders winning on a daily basis or oh my gosh this person made this much and I lost today man I'm not going to make it or how come this person was able to get this amount of money in a payout and they've only been trading for six months and I've been trying to do this for two years why why do they get it not me you guys need to tune out all of that bullshit and honestly one of the biggest things for me was literally unfollowing every single day trader on YouTube I stopped watching all these strategy videos I stopped watching their trade recaps I unfollowed every single trader that I was following on Instagram and at the time when I was trying to learn how to trade take talk wasn't a thing or I don't even think I had it downloaded at the time but unfollow all these people including myself especially if you guys are really trying to get this done like this video is awesome and it's great for you guys and maybe you guys see a video or two of mine that like pops up and you're like hey this is actually addressing a specific question that's going to help my trading journey but for the most part you guys need to focus on your own success comparison truly is the thief of joy and it's also going to be holding you guys back because if you keep comparing yourselves to all these other people who are online and again like I was saying the wins are escalated you guys are just going to forever be thinking like what do they have that I don't and then that causes the over education cycle that causes you guys to want to look more and deeper into YouTube videos you guys need to stop that just focus on your own journey and this is another big thing it's just like journaling your trades and seeing the difference of trades from a month ago to now or seeing the difference in your trading and how you guys understand price action from like a year ago compared to now and actually seeing that progress something that sucks about trading is there's like the super black and white of like boom you're either unprofitable or you're profitable and when you're in that unprofitable stage it's just very apparent like you are consistently losing money so it's super hard to be able to actually track your progress but if you guys are journaling your trades you guys can look back on like several years or several months worth of trades and you can say like oh damn I've actually made progress even though I'm not necessarily profitable yet that's going to keep you guys going and the last thing is just understanding that everybody's on a different timeline okay so if you and your friends are trying to do this and one of your friends is able to like find success a little bit quicker than you it's okay okay every every single one of us as humans is different everybody is in a different head spacing people learn to pick up things at different rates so just focus on your own success focus on your own growth and you guys are truly going to become better traders by doing that again like I said in these YouTube videos I can only cover like little bits and pieces of what I think just the overall vague umbrella of unprofitable traders if you guys want to be taught or mentored by me personally you guys can join the TJR trades blueprint in the description again this is something similar where it's like you guys would actually be able to get on a discord call with me ask your direct trading questions and that is something that is actually beneficial where you guys can get in there and that's where I'm able to smooth out all of these like direct trading mistakes that you guys are making on a daily basis and how do I know that you guys are making them on a daily basis you guys are coming to me and you guys are telling me saying hey I'm making this mistake and I'm just like boom I've made this mistake so many times where I know the exact cure for it versus these videos it's like look I'm just trying to put like an overall umbrella like how can I help these unprofitable traders just get a good overall base to be able to get them where they want to go but if you're somebody that's been at this for a really long time and you guys already know all the shit that I covered in this video and you're like man there's really just like a couple things that I think I'm missing or a couple things that I need like actual professional coaching with and that's where I'm going to be able to help you but for the most part if you're an absolute beginner bro don't even bother with that shit and just focus on these YouTube videos but don't get too involved with them okay focus on these YouTube videos build that overall base and those fundamentals and trust me you guys will be well on your way to profitability that being said I love and appreciate you guys I'll catch you guys in the next one peace out

=== VIDEO 3/34 : 7 Trading Rules That Changed My Life-VTwmHVAX29o.txt
============================================

Look I have been trading for years now and as you guys know, I made good money from the markets on top of that I've also lost a little bit of money I've made a whole bunch of money and then gave it all back to the market But now I've been able to consistently make money from the markets for the past couple years now And the goal is to help you guys be able to do the same and these are going to be seven rules that really change the game in Terms of trading for me that don't necessarily require any sort of strategy or indicator or chart work that once I Implemented these things for me it took a lot longer because I just kept making the same mistake over and over and over again And it took me like six months to get past all of these things and then once I realized it I was like oh my gosh, why was I being so dumb? So I wanted to put all of these in one video for you guys so that you guys can implement them right now So either you guys can stop making the same exact mistakes that I kept making over and over and over again or so you guys can just Avoid these mistakes as a whole if you guys haven't made them yet if you guys are dealing with some of these then stick to the end Because this is going to be super useful for you guys and again trading is not all about strategy a lot of it has to do with mindset And a lot of it has to do with the rules that you're implementing in your own life and also once you implement it into your life You will be able to implement it into your trading so with that being said let's get into rule number one So number one biggest rule is never trade without a plan. This was a pretty drastic mistake I think when everybody starts off learning how to day trade they go Overboard on the planning and then they end up like writing down all these rules and they stick to the rules religiously But then what happens is they watch more and more YouTube videos and they see the lifestyle They see the cars they see the chains they see the watches and then they kind of get sucked into this and they're like How can I live this life right the freak now and then they start trading as if they should be living that life right now Which they shouldn't be because they haven't done the work in the first place And that's exactly what happened to me where when I first started I had my trading plan I had my risk management plan I had my psychology plan and I wrote all these things down and I followed it religiously and believe it or not I was actually trading pretty good as a beginner But then I watched more and more YouTube videos. I almost got information overload and I started trying all these new things And then next thing I know I'm trading with a strategy that Doesn't really follow any of the rules that I had already laid out in the first place I'm risking way more than my risk management plan had and I'm taking way more trades and I'm trading emotionally Not following my psychological plan and it ended up fucking me up for a long time and literally like the entire time that I was unprofitable I had a plan set up But I wouldn't follow it literally every single day and I'll look over this plan I'm like yep all this stuff makes sense and then I'll go and I would trade against it every single day and believe it or not What happens when you trade against your plan you end up losing more than you end up winning? So this is just a super simple super awesome reminder for you guys to stick to the plan that you guys have and I know It sounds dumb and I know it sounds super simple and obvious like Doug to J.R I'm going to stick to my plan But you guys are fucking up and you guys are not sticking to your plan every single day and you know how I know this It's because I was doing the same exact shit I had a plan but then for whatever reason there would be trading days where I wouldn't stick to it And then I'll give all the money that I made from that week or that month back to the market when I wasn't sticking to my plan So I know that first one is super obvious But please there's a reason why we have plans in the first place It's to help us be probable within the markets It's to help us have a high probability of making money and being consistent with making money because if we don't stick to our plan We immediately just boom shoot our probability in the freaking head then what are we left with we're left with Unprobable conditions with how we're trading Okay, let's move into number two. Okay, so rule number two is how to size up and the rule that we can call this is Sizing up after consistency not after profit This one was a brutal one and I've told this story many times But if you guys remember back when I was learning how to trade I was able to turn ten thousand dollars into a hundred twelve thousand dollars and then the very next day I lost it all What was I doing wrong? How can you guys avoid doing the same thing and how can you guys not follow in my footsteps so that you guys can actually Size up scale compound your trading account but by doing it in a safe and Responsible manner so that you're not overriscing and you're not over leveraging and you're not going to entice yourself to fall into these Psychological issues as you start sizing up so my biggest issue was I had one winning day and it was like wow This was huge and keep in mind. I was also over leveraging. I wasn't following my plan during that winning day So there's a lot of mistakes that I was making I have a winning day and what did I do? I noticed that hey my account size is now three times bigger than what I started with so with that in mind I should do three times the amount that I was entering with before and keep in mind before I was still over leveraging So now I'm over leveraging by three X the amount and I did it again and guess what I got really fucking lucky and For two days in a row. I got really lucky. I was able to flip that account I was literally able to 10X it and then guess what on the third day what happened boom lost it all because I followed that exact same thing So how can we learn to size up with consistency rather than sizing up with profits? This is something that I implement on a daily basis for me where I'm not sizing up my risk with every single day's worth of profit So let's say we have like a $10,000 account and let's say over two weeks or three weeks We're able to make $1,000 so we get a 10% return. That's really freaking good Okay, we get a 10% return. We're up a thousand dollars does that mean I'm going to start risking based on that $11,000 Account balance for me. I would say no because ideally we are going to be trading with the same amount that we're comfortable with The amount that we were comfortable with was ideally again that $10,000 account balance size So whatever size we were using there to be able to grow the account to $11,000 to be able to get that 10% return We weren't over leveraging we weren't over trading We weren't enticing any of those psychological emotions that cause us to make bad decisions within the market And if we were to size up then who knows that might cause us to get a little bit emotional because now we're risking more than We were doing just this past week or the past two weeks ago So what I like to do is I like to just follow consistency So over time I'm continuously risking the same amount and if I notice hey and you guys have very short timelines I'm not saying after a week size up. I'm not saying after a month size up I'm saying like after multiple quarters so like two quarters after six months You're like hey, I've been trading super consistently. I've been making good profits Then you can put yourself in the headspace to be like okay now I have the ability to be able to size up my risk because I've grown this account now let's say 30% or 40% Where now it's actually doing myself a disservice by risking too little Okay, so what I like to do is I like to prove to myself hey, I've been consistent with this risk amount My account balance has grown drastically while being consistent with this risk amount And now this is going to be a big change I'm willing to risk a little bit more and if you notice that once you start risking a little bit more You start falling into these emotional traps. You stop following your plan You start over trading you start over leveraging then boom you got to rotate it right back down to that original risk That you were using where emotions aren't involved. Okay, so that was a big one for me where I was so eager to increase my size Because I was like I want to get rich quick That's not what day trading is okay You're no one ever is going to get rich quick from day trading or any side hustle for that man So again, you want to size with consistency as your skill set grows Not as your account balance grows. Okay, so again once you notice that hey I'm leveling up as a trader and I'm telling you this right now You don't level up as a trader within one week. You don't level up as a trader within one month It's just like the gym. Okay, you go to the gym you lift and you're lifting weights You're going to see progress over like a couple months You're not going to see progress within a week. You may might see a little progress within a month But that doesn't mean you should just start altering everything. Okay, so that's rule number two super big one size after consistency Rule number three is going to be you guys only need one fucking strategy holy shit I'm going to breeze through the screen and I'm going to punch you guys in the face if you guys keep switching strategies This was something that literally put a pause on my growth as a Unprofitable trader towards being a profitable trader I would watch one youtuber and I would try out their strategy and then it would work for like a week And then it would stop it would stop working But again, we need to expand our time horizons on this we have to understand that trading isn't just one week's worth of data It's not just a couple days worth of data. Okay, so if you guys try out a strategy and after the first day It doesn't work because you took a singular loss on that day Maybe that means you just don't know the consequences well enough Maybe that means it's your first fucking day using the strategy and you guys probably aren't going to be the best at trading that way So you need to give yourself time and ideally you guys find a strategy that not only makes sense to you guys And why you guys are placing trades and why you guys are literally betting money that price is going to move in the direction that you want it to go And then also you find a strategy that works for you that works for whatever your work schedule is whatever your school schedule is Because if you guys aren't doing that then again you guys are doing yourself a disservice So if you guys want to trade like me I have give you guys full in depth detail on how you guys can use my confluences use my strategy Not only in the free course linked down below But also in my mentorship if you guys want to become one of my students and actually ask me personal questions Get on coaching calls with me so I can figure out all of your personal questions that might not be answered on these YouTube videos That's fine But regardless of that Find one strategy that works for you. Okay. That was like one of my biggest mistakes is I was just jumping from this strategy Doesn't work anymore this strategy doesn't work anymore this strategy doesn't work anymore That's like jumping from side hustle to side hustle to side hustle without even giving it enough time to play out Okay, because you guys are going to suck at it strategies are just like any other skill You guys are going to suck in the beginning And then you guys are going to figure things out you guys are going to make mistakes And you guys are going to grow from those mistakes and then eventually it's going to play out At the end of the day, it really doesn't matter what fucking strategy you guys using day trading I don't even care if you guys use my strategy my strategy makes sense to me That's why I trade it if my strategy doesn't make sense to you awesome go watch another youtuber I'm literally encouraging you guys to go watch another youtuber find a strategy that works for you That makes sense for you and why they trade it and then boom stick to that single one and then just grind it out until you're an absolute pro with it Because if you guys jump from strategy to strategy you're again Killing all of your probabilities within the market because you're trading differently every single day Goes back to rule one we have to trade with a plan rule number four If you guys are feeling off don't freaking trade This is a huge one when it comes to psychology Okay, if you guys are Travelling and you guys are on a freaking plane believe it or not I have placed trades while on a plane and guess what happened to those trades I got stopped out why because I'm not in the mental headspace that I need to be If I'm not in my office looking at the charts and not in completely locked in trading mode There's a negative reason for you guys to be trading not one bit Okay, it's just like how can I explain this like you need to be in the zone This is your full-time job if you aren't able to treat this like a full-time job Then you are not going to get the results that you are expecting as if it was a full-time job If you have acid if you treat it like a game if you treat it like a slot machine If you treat it like a casino Then you guys are never going to make money from this you guys have to be focused you guys have to be locked in a great example is of this Let's say I break up with my girlfriend that causes a lot of emotions Okay, I might be feeling down. I might be feeling sad I'm not in it mentally if I'm sitting down and I'm looking at the charts and my brain is all over the place I should not be trading that day same thing for you guys if you guys have Some sort of emotional things that are going on in your life. Maybe your parents passed away God forbid okay, or maybe your grandparents passed away maybe a pet passed away you guys are I don't know why I think those as examples, but You guys get what I'm saying if you guys are in an emotional state where you guys are emotionally unstable That is the worst time the worst time for you guys to go and trade Just like how it's the worst time in life to go out and try and like take away all those emotions You need to process those emotions. You need to fully process get your grieving said and done get whatever those emotions are Are doing to you? Process them and get them out and get them out of the way because it's going to affect you the the more you try and push them out Okay, because it's just going to be forever lingering do what you need to do Take days off from the market because you guys aren't going to be in the mental headspace to be able to trade because what happens If you guys are already sad and then you guys go and place a trade and then you guys lose that trade You're going to crash the fuck out You're going to probably want to place another trade because you want that dopamine hit You want to be able to feel good and actually maybe turn your day around because you're feeling sad Oh, no, I need to chase this win and then what are we end up doing trading without a plan over leveraging over trading and then boom Guess what happens we end up losing our account believe it or not this happened to me very frequently Okay, I used to deal with a whole bunch of mental health issues still do okay My my emotions are are sometimes out of whack I have been able to enjoy myself alone and I've been able to process my emotions Way, way better and I tribute a lot of that due to my discipline to be a good day trader Before all of this when I was an unprofitable day trader and when I was still trying to figure out trading I struggled a lot with my emotions not just within trading but specifically in my own life Okay, I went through a lot of hard times mentally where I was depressed I was anxious and it was very difficult For me to be able to process those emotions because I was using other things bad things like drugs and alcohol as an outlet for me or not as an outlet As just like a block okay, so I'll tune out all of those emotions But then guess what you wake up the next morning and you're sober and all those emotions come back So what did I have to do I just sit myself down and I had to tell myself look you have to process your own emotions You have to be comfortable with yourself when you're alone now I live in this big-ass house all alone With my dog that's literally sleeping right next to me and I actually love being alone Why because I'm comfortable in my own skin and I know how to process my emotions now And I tribute a lot of that two day trading if you guys want to become a good day trader and you guys are in one of those bad mental health Ruts understand that not only you processing these emotions and you helping yourself get out of this rut Well, you're alone while you're at rock bottom because I was there before and I know how it feels It feels like nobody's there to help you it feels like nobody fucking loves you and it feels like the world is just against you That's when you have yourself and that's when you have God to talk to where you can sit yourself down And you can say look I have all of these things that are going against me So there's only one person that can help me out of this and it's myself Okay, you can sit yourself down and you just literally like let those emotions pour out There's so many times where I was just like sitting in my bed like when I first moved to Puerto Rico I remember the first night I was in my house alone and I was sitting on my bed and I was like I have no friends here I have nobody that is here to support me and I'm freaking the fuck out right now. I got super anxious and I started crying and it was just like I don't know what the fuck to do um and Instead of causing throwing a huge fit. Okay, I let myself process those emotions and I said hey How are we going to figure this out? How am I going to make the most out of this opportunity because I know that me moving Okay, and me putting myself in that super uncomfortable situation was actually the best opportunity of my entire life And you guys saw how much I progress since moving to Puerto Rico and since doing all that like my life is continuously changing For the better because I'm getting better at processing my emotions and again This one's super personal to me because I've dealt with just a whole bunch of mental health issues And I'm sure that this is going to be uh personal to you guys as well because More often than not if you guys want to get into day trading It's typically because you guys don't really relate to a lot of people that are in your friend group or your friend group Okay, or within your social circle or within your environment you want to do something else You want to be your own boss and you guys are just going to have to go through those tough times in order to make it out In order to fully enjoy your life So please do yourself a favor and do me a favor for you guys Understand that I was in your exact position before as well process those emotions let them flow out Okay, and just take a deep breath you got this and understand that you are the person that is going to be able to change your own life Rule number five do not have fear of missing out don't have phomo, okay? Do not chase trades so this one's pretty self-explanatory But this kind of ties into emotions a lot of times we'll get into the charts and we will map out our daily bias And our daily bias will start Maybe playing out or it will have already played out and then we're like oh damn it That was like the trade that I wanted to take but I didn't take it because my influences didn't line up And now I should have made money today So now I want to force myself to make money today and I got to do all these things in order to make this happen like no No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, okay We're not going to do that if your daily bias played out then awesome you were able to predict where the market went for the day That's a win, okay? That's a win in my book today's a perfect example for me I got out of the charts. I had my daily bias my daily bias played out without me and what did I do? I just didn't take a trade okay I didn't have the influences in order for me to enter a date out of the market is better than a date in the market Statistically for our own probability because if we get into the market and we're just chasing price like let's say We have our daily bias and boom it plays out and you're like man I should have made money today I want to make that money that I should have made and then you start chasing trades We're literally going against rule number one. We need to stick to our plan for daily bias plays out You just have to be comfortable with that okay be comfortable Not taking trades that's like one of the biggest things that every single beginner trader falls into bro And it's like me now looking at you guys. I'm like how well like how are you guys falling into this? But then I think back to myself when I was unprofitable and I totally get how you guys fell into it now I'm comfortable not taking any trades on a daily basis. I'll take like leg last week I only took one trade But that one trade was a substantial amount of profit and it was good for me Okay, and it was the only good setup that I saw that week today I didn't see a trade so I'm not going to take it the best traders in the entire world are not taking trades on a daily basis So what makes you think that you as an unprofitable trader are better than all of the best traders in the world Who deemed the market not fit to trade every single day? It doesn't make sense and some of you guys are even taking multiple trades every single day That is not okay at all Okay, you guys need to understand when the market is good to trade and when again just stick to your plan If your plan says hey now's a good time to trade awesome take that shot But if your plan doesn't play out and you guys aren't able to take a trade just leave bro Be done because there's no probability for you within the market Why because it's not following your plan rule number six Journal your fucking trades journal journal your fucking trades or else you guys are going to be taking shots and taking trades And then if you guys win or if you guys lose you guys won't even know what to do again or what not to do again One of the biggest turning points for me was journaling my trades and noticing Mistakes that I was making on a daily basis where it's like oh hey I Toked trade without waiting for this confluence the past six times I lost and then the past four times that I won I waited for that confluence and believe it or not once I stop doing that and once I started waiting for that confluence Guess what your win rate immediately will go up by tracking This is something that I tell all of my mentors ship students within the blueprint if you guys are not tracking your own data Then how do you expect to be able to find room for improvement? It's one thing where you guys are like oh, yeah, I've had like emotional things and that's kind of like all over the place We can't really use data to like track that but when it comes to actually placing freaking trades We can track literally every single ounce of data and the best way to do that is by having a trade journal Okay, so right whether it was a long position whether it was a short position What you guys risked on that day what confluence is you guys use right every single thing that Cause you guys to place the trade in the first place And then after the fact right like a post-trade recap So you place the trade you write down every every single thing that you guys did And then after the fact you write down every single thing that you did right and every single thing that you did wrong So you can look back and be like hey when I do this thing over and over and over again I end up winning a lot more or when I do this over and over and over again I end up losing a lot. So believe it or not, when you stop doing the things that are causing you to lose and when you do more of the things that are causing you to win Guess what happens your win rate goes up and your money goes up the seventh last and final rule that every single one of you guys should apply is How you treat your life is how you guys are going to treat your own training? This is kind of going to encapsulate everything into one and it's as simple as this if you guys are not Discipline in your own life if you guys are not consistent in your own life What makes you think that you will be disciplined and consistent within your own trading something that I repeat all the time to my mentorship students something that I repeat all the time to you guys is If you guys are acting a certain way out in the real world out in life and it doesn't follow Necessarily the same plan or the same emotional standpoint or the same rules that you expect to apply yourself and do within your own trading Why do you think that you can be disciplined and consistent within just one tiny aspect within your own life and then live a completely reckless and Crazy drastic different life then this one little thing that you want to master you guys want to master Drain trading you have to master your own life and that goes down to strategy that comes down to emotions that comes down to risk So a lot of you guys are unprofitable traders not even from the things that you guys are doing Not even from the things that you guys are doing within trading, but it's how you guys are treating your own life You guys are living like absolute fucking bombs. You guys are inconsistent. You guys are emotional and you guys aren't disciplined for shit And then you wonder why you aren't able to be consistent be disciplined and have good emotional headspace when you're trading It's because in life you guys aren't even able to follow that for yourselves One of the biggest turning points in my trading career was when I realized that trading is more than just trading Whenever you guys are trying to get into a side hustle or just be self-employed or be able to work for yourself be your own boss Your work is your life. Okay. There's not a single day that I am not working. Okay. No matter what I work 365 days a year Okay, and a lot of people in the real world that work nine to five jobs They can go through the motions within their own jobs Why because they know that they have a paycheck coming their way? They know that they can be a little bit sloppy with their work They know that they can be a little bit undisciplined as long as they aren't going to get fired But when you're working for yourself every single thing matters because you are the one that determines who gets paid Okay, you are the one that determines if you perform well or not. Okay, so that's what a lot of people like they just they think It's the same thing as just like going through the motions of a regular job And it's not this has to be your entire life if you guys actually want to make this work If you guys actually want to be able to be successful within trading you guys have to prioritize Trading as your life. Okay, like I know it sounds maybe a little bit scary or a little bit crazy But that that's what it takes in order to be successful in this and in order to be successful in really any line of work Where you're your own boss because you yourself are the determiner of what happens within your own business or what happens within your own Own side hustle. Okay, so if you guys can take anything from this video Please do yourself a favor turn your life around you guys are you guys need to do a full 180 of your life and start Notting all these things off. Okay, you guys have to be disciplined you guys have to be consistent You guys have to show up every single day. This is something that I was telling someone over the weekend And they came up to me and they were like oh, dude your huge inspiration What's something that you can tell me that can help me get to your level and I told them this you have to be disciplined And you have to show up every single day every single day It's easy for us to get one percent better. We are able to get one percent better every single day There are going to be some days where we get three hundred percent better four hundred percent better But if we aren't showing up every single day to get one percent better We might miss those three hundred percent better opportunities We might miss those four hundred percent better days and the only way to see those exponential growth and to be able to Literally create your own luck by being in the position to be able to get lucky is by showing up every single day and being consistent So again these rules they didn't just make me a better trader They made trading easier for me.

=== VIDEO 4/34 : Day Trading For Beginners： The Complete Starter Guide 2025-a5PLl1uM7CQ.txt
============================================

The sad reality about day trading is that 99% of day traders are unable to pass their first funded account or they blow their first live account pretty much just sending a whole bunch of money into the market and never being able to capitalize on it. And if you're like one of the traders that is trying to day trade with little to no money to your name under $1,000, the odds are pretty much stacked against you. What if I told you guys that I would be able to show you guys the way to one, avoid all of those mistakes, avoid giving money back to the market, avoid giving money to these pro firms and losing money and instead be able to be profitable on a live account and actually be able to pass a funded account so you can get a payout from a pro firm. That's my goal with this video today is to show you guys how you guys can not only start with super low capital within day trading but also be able to capitalize and leverage your capital to the best of your abilities so that you guys can start day trading off on the right foot unlike everybody else. Okay so before we get onto the charts and I just show you breakdown all the confluencees and strategy that's the stuff that you guys love. I need to preface this and say that the majority of the mistakes that you guys will be making when blowing live accounts and blowing funded accounts doesn't really have to do with strategy. I'm going to teach you guys a strategy within this video and break some confluencees down and explain how you guys can read the market with proficiency but I know that is going to be the highlighted part of this video and I don't want it to be the majority of the mistakes that you guys are going to be making that are causing you guys to lose your first thousand dollars from day trading and blow fund of the accounts is purely from psychology and your own risk management. So I just want to preface that. I'm going to give you guys different psychology rules, different psychology tips and different risk management tools and give breakdown and risk management strategy for both forms of trading whether you're trading on a live account or whether you're trading on a pro firm and then I'm also going to give you a strategy but I just want to preface that because I know you guys are getting in here and you're like bet I'm going to learn TJR's pro firm strategy and boom we made it and for the most part you guys already know my strategy. You guys already know the confluencees so if you guys are going to continue watching this video it's not for the strategy and I know this is going to cause a whole bunch of people to leave the video I'm fucking fine with that leave because I don't you guys are never going to be successful in trade. The only people that are going to be successful in trading understand that becoming a good and successful and profitable day trader it takes three very important skills not only does it take an edge within the market edge no good okay I'm talking about I'm talking about strategy fully understanding where price wants to go but not only that if you only have this you're still screwed you also need psychology and you also need risk management if you don't have these two you're fucked and if you only have two of them you're still fucked you need all three and hopefully that's the message and what I can teach you guys in today's video so let's get on the charts let's talk about some strategy then from there we'll talk about psychology then from there we'll talk about some risk management plans okay let's get into it okay so like I was saying what makes a profitable trader in the first place we need strategy we need psychology and we need risk management now if you are a beginner trader first of all I'm glad that you're on this video but another thing I want you to watch through this video and then I'm going to instruct you on a couple things that I need you to do in order to fully understand and fully develop strategy now I would love to get on here break down every single confluence that I know break down every single combination of these confluencees and how to actually use it in a day trading strategy so that you guys can be successful within the markets I would love to do that I really would however that would make this video literally five hours long and the best part about this I already made that video for you guys so if you guys want to learn and fully understand my day trading strategy like head to freaking toe I was about to say head to balls but even better that way okay head to toe fully understand my day trading strategy from confluencees to how we're supposed to put it together and if you guys are brand new to trading go watch that five hour long video it's going to tell you guys every single thing that you need now once you guys go and do that now is where I'll be able to break down like the best way to take trades using that strategy and using all of those confluencees so if you guys know me know how I trade know the confluencees that I use then awesome we're going to break down a really awesome strategy that is going to be super beneficial not only for live accounts but also for fun to come so top to bottom and also if you guys aren't familiar with me or how I trade just stay stay here okay I'm going to break down a strategy and you're probably like okay I already know all these confluencees I can go ahead and apply this today so again like I said profitable trader we need three trades okay strategy number one psychology number two risk management number three the priority is okay all three or top priority we need to be good at all of them those are the three skills that we need to max out okay so first strategy this is really how I'm going to be looking at the markets when I'm going into it especially with very low capital okay we need to be more risk off than risk on and right now damn near every single one of you guys is doing the opposite you guys are trying to be more risk on then risk off so we only want to be taking high quality trades how are we going to be doing that by looking at the higher time frame trend by looking at okay yes maybe we have more wiggle room when you're dealing with like millions of dollars in a trading account but you guys are dealing with under a thousand dollars in a trading trading account every single trade every single win every single loss matters to you guys same thing with fundants okay you guys are very strict drawdown rules so we only want to be taking high quality trades and how are we going to be able to do that by I know this sounds corny and I know this sounds and everybody loves saying like okay like oh this is this is too beginner news flash the simpler you make it the easier it's going to be for you to become a profitable trader I know I'm about to go on a mini rant here before we get into this but I think you guys need to understand this a new mega highly advanced confluence isn't going to turn you profitable I've really I truly truly get pissed the fuck off when traders especially traders that don't even make money like I hate when traders that don't even make money that can't even pass a freaking funded account that aren't trading with real life funds go to me and say tjr what you teach is too beginner I need something advanced bro I literally make a shit ton of money trading the way that I do you don't need anything more advanced anything more advanced is going to confuse you even fucking more and you are ready suck at it you suck at the beginner shit and you're looking for something more advanced this is the biggest issue they skip over the beginner shit because they're like oh this isn't going to take me anywhere I want to learn how to do a between the legs 360 reverse layup but they don't even know how to dribble the fucking ball yet they don't even know how to label simple ass confluence they don't even know how to identify draws on liquidity and then they're talking about tjr is too basic and too beginner I need to learn power of three and I need to learn an smt rsi fucking zone divergence know the fuck you don't you don't need to fucking know that you know why because I'm making way more than you are and you're not even profitable put the pieces together Timmy it's not me it's you now that we've cleared that up it's very easy you guys literally saw me pass a fund in account in front of your fucking eyes on my trade recaps it was so fucking easy this was the first fund in account that I've even attempted to do in years and I passed it in literally a single fucking week and you're telling me my concepts don't work oh my goodness you are so dumb you are actually on the spectrum man get a blood test there's gotta be a chromosome missing let's lock in step number one look at the high time frame will literally break the shit down trend slash order flow okay if we can see and identify what the high time frame trend or order flow is and if we can follow that we will be able to take higher quality trades higher risk reward trades and overall be more successful do I very frequently trade against the higher time frame trend and higher time frame frame order flow yes why because I have capital to spare you guys do not don't try and be TJR he has years of experience in the market compared to you we need to start basic simple fundamental this is going to give you guys high quality trades okay number one we're only looking for trades that are within the high time frame trend so perfect example that what high time frame trend are we in right now down notice every single move up besides this one within this downtrend is super choppy it's either moving sideways or it's barely moving up so if you're trying to take longs within any of this you're either getting chopped up losing the trade or having a very low risk reward trade and not hitting a high risk reward these are very small movements again besides this move up here the only move up that probably would have given you a significant risk reward so we have one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven eleven shitty and dog shit in sideways consolidation retraces on the high time frame and one of them was only worthy of a good high quality higher risk reward trade all in all we should be avoiding that especially if we've limited capital number two this should be fucking obvious it's again T.J.R you're too simple well Timmy you can't stick to your trading plan and you're blaming me it's not me it's you you Timmy listen to me brother shut the fuck up okay listen to me the reason why you're not passing funded accounts isn't because you don't know the enigma it's because you can't stick to your fucking plan and I know you're probably saying well make me a trading plan don't worry little boy I will do that for you literally I'll give you this step by fucking step I wasn't even planning on doing this but here we go T.J.R. to the fucking rescue again he's got to do everything around here because god damn it there's Timmy's running all over the place and it's really been pissing me off lately hence why I'm making these really high quality videos and actual a whole bunch of education because god damn it I thought I fixed the day trading space I made it worse with the retards that are running around we got to clean clean this shit up again okay what's our day trading plan high time frame liquidity sweep followed by low time frame break of structure or inverse for value gap again if you don't know these confluences or what I'm talking about pause this video go watch that five hour long video that I mentioned or watch my free course watch my bootcamp I literally have a bajillion other videos that are going over these confluences again this is assuming that you know these confluences high time frame liquidity sweep followed by low time frame break of structure or inverse for like app for the wow down syndrome okay followed by inverse for value gap followed by low time frame I'll just put confluence and then in parentheses fair value gap order block break of block equilibrium okay look at the high time frame trend in order flow we're in bearish order flow awesome we're only looking for cells and I know you're probably saying well well I will be able to take as many trades that's the fucking point you suck at trading right now so the it's like I'm like your basketball coach your name is Timmy I want to shoot three point I was couch Timmy you're old for fucking 50 from three point line the only shots you can take our layups because those are the only ones that you're making right now no Timmy you suck you can't even hoop against the 24 hour fitness people you are ass that is how you guys are in day trading right now not to hurt your feeling it's about if I'm hurting your feelings then I'm telling the truth if something hurts your feelings typically it's because it's striking a little cord because it's the truth okay high time frame liquidity fallout by low time frame breaker structure we're in first I get followed by low time frame confluence fair value gap order block the like break of block equilibrium in line with the high time frame trend from there target high time frame liquidity and fair value gaps this will limit the amount of trades that you can take but maximum your winrate and max out your risk reward however keep in mind if you don't know what any of this shit means obviously you are not going to be a billionaire on top of that on top of that if you just learned about what these things are don't come running back to the comment section and be like I tried it and miss you took one trade Timmy and that is going to lead me into the next steps that we have to do before even risking any money in the market before even we use that one thousand dollars because there's a lot of things that I want to preface to you guys before we even turn this into psychology you can do this money motivation billionaire Miami super car okay before we even start talking about that what we need to do first is just again build the fundamentals this is going to keep you safe once you have the fundamentals okay so boom this is the breakdown this is what we're trying to do now following up on that what do we need to do before we even go into this number one be profitable on demo okay there's going to be a brokerage link in the in the description for you guys to be able to practice with fake and paper money you're probably saying well I have a thousand dollars ready to go right now ready to make a billion dollars that is why you keep fucking losing money bro that's why you keep fucking losing money and that's why I'm literally losing sleep over you guys that's why you guys keep losing money because you guys haven't proven to yourself that you are profitable on paper trading paper trading is by far one of the most beneficial tools in day trading and it's free okay the awesome thing about demo trading and paper trading is you guys can literally learn the skill of trading without having to put a dollar into the market and then once you have the skill of trading you can then put your harder money into the market and actually start risking so obviously that's what we're going to want to going to want to do we need to be unprofitable on demo first so again a lot of you guys are probably going to ask well does that mean I have to win one trade and then I'm good to go no because I can guarantee you Timmy he makes one three pointer and he's gonna think he's stepping curry no that is we're not letting him and letting him think that okay I want and I guess what every single one of you guys you guys are gonna be like well this is too long I want it now well guess what you don't get you don't get rich quick newsflash if you guys came out of my channel and you're like I want to bravest I want to mantery rolls arise cullinan do you guys know how long it took me to get to that point okay I'm not saying it's impossible matter of fact it's possible and probably even more possible for every single one of you guys because you guys have a good mentor in me but what I need you guys to understand it didn't happen overnight it didn't happen within my first year of profitability I went unprofitable for two fucking years I was broke I literally had to turn my entire life around and start whooping my own ass to be able to get to where I'm at and then from that point from like rock bottom for me it took me fuck row it's been like five years since then six years so I don't want you guys being like when am I going to be TJR I don't want you guys to be thinking that I want you guys to be thinking okay I know that this is going to take a long time but if I can just focus on learning the skill of day trading then it is going to bless me for the rest of my life infinitely this skill is infinitely scalable it is the most valuable skill in any online space because it is infinitely scalable and the only thing that is holding you back is your capital and that's what this video is about how you guys can leverage this skill and then from their leverage your capital so the first thing that I need you guys to do is be profitable on demo for three months I know you guys are probably saying holy shit that's such a long time guess what success takes a long time and I'm saying this now and I I would like to make a prediction that five percent of the people that are watching this video will not make it to this three month point of profitability and they will jump into trading on a live account and they will jump into trading on a funded account and what is going to happen with those accounts they are going to lose their money and they are going to get super emotional and they are going to get super upset and then they are going to quit day trading and that is what makes 99% of day traders fail them wanting to get rich quick if you guys can see and understand that this skill can bless you for the rest of your life and you guys can be in this for the long game not the short-term game I promise you I fucking promise you you guys will be able to be way more successful than anybody else in this so be profitable on demo for three months that means three straight months of green PNL on paper trading on demo trading I know that seems like a long time but you just you gotta trust me okay step number two you have to be using proper risk management okay and I'm going to be going into how we can use proper risk management not only on a funded account but also on a live account okay later in this video and so we'll get we'll get back to this and again we need to be doing this prior to actually risking our money on this we can use this to learn how and and attempt to be profitable on demo for three months straight but again remember this just plugging this in isn't going to turn you profitable overnight there are thousands upon thousands of day trading strategy videos on YouTube and if it were as easy as seeing a YouTube video and a strategy from a YouTube video copying it and then boom turning profitable right after you learn the strategy every single person would be profitable but we know that's not the case 99% of day traders fail so we know it's not all just about copy and paste the strategy this is a strategy that works for me this is a strategy that I would like to say will work for you but you have to understand that not only will it take time for you to master the strategy it's not just some copy and paste thing you guys have to get market experience okay so be profitable on demo for three months you have to be using proper risk and you have to be disciplined notice how the top how literally the three fundamentals are going back to the three fucking skills that require you to be a profitable day trader number one strategy number two risk management number three psychology number one profitable confluence and strategy you have to use proper risk risk management you have to be disciplined psychology so I already gave you guys like a mini step by step on how you guys can practice the skill of profitability practice the skill of strategy and confluence within the market via this I want you guys to back test like a motherfucker I want you guys to journal trades like a motherfucker you wonder how I got to where I'm at I always pull up this freaking notebook because bro I like this is just fucking pages on freaking pages of bro like pages on freaking I know you guys can't see it's a little bit of a flashbang but pages and on pages of trade of trade recaps bro of journaling trades and this is back when I was unprofitable okay and I still I still do it today this shit never ends so if you guys want to be like the best if you guys want to be profitable you guys have to do what profitable traders do and profitable traders journal okay number two how can we use proper risk management let's break it down now the biggest thing there's a couple things with risk management first of all there's going to be two different strategies for risk management if you're on funded or if you're on live okay so we need to understand that because funded we have to be way more risk adverse versus when we're trading on a live account again we have to be profitable first this is when we're starting to put put money down and I'm going to break down once we go through all of this I'm going to show you guys how you guys can leverage your money to your advantage so that you guys are going to be able to capitalize on the these step-by-step that I'm giving you guys to be able to turn profitable and to be able to actually succeed within the markets okay so not only am I giving you guys day trading strategy I'm giving you guys risk management strategy and then I'm going to give you guys tips on how to practice discipline and how to practice psychology within the markets so risk management number one if you guys are on a funded account I mean this this is the problem a lot of pro firms have different rules and different drawdown rules different profit targets so it's going to be varying from pro firm to pro firm but the biggest piece of advice that I can give to you guys on funded accounts is understand the amount of trades you have are limited okay you have to understand that the amount of trades that you have are limited what do I mean by this on pro firms when let's say I buy a funded account and it's $100 without $100 and let's say it's a one-step pro firm account that $100 essentially grants me anywhere from again it depends if you're doing it on a CFD pro firm a 4x pro firm or a futures pro firm but we'll give you guys a range okay that pro firm or that $100 grants me the opportunity to leverage my money across it's going to be anywhere from three to 10 trades again I know that's kind of a wide range but understand that that that is the amount of trades that you are limited to with that amount of capital that you're going into the market with so if you're limited to three to 10 trades you are ideally going to want to be not only managing your risk but also only be taking high quality setups now just because you are limited to three to 10 trades on your funded account doesn't mean I want you guys to be risking like way less so you guys can take more trades I'm just saying we have to take higher quality trades and that's what this is going to help us do so again we have to be profitable before applying this and the biggest thing that I want you guys to understand here this goes a bit into psychology but it's just the fact that we are limited by the amount of trades that we have and how can I explain this even deeper it's like you need to not think about the payout that you could potentially get from this pro firm you need to think about one step at a time so you need to be thinking when you're on the challenge portion of the pro firm you need to be thinking what trades are going to be high quality high risk reward and be worth a risk because the amount of trades that we have are limited on the money that I have spent a lot of you guys throw money into funded accounts and don't even like process or realize the money that you're losing or have spent once you buy it you need to think that each trade you are taking is essentially either money made or money lost because again let's say we spend a hundred dollars on a funded account and we are limited to three trades each trade lost is negative thirty three dollars for us and I know that may not seem like a lot to some of you guys and I know that may seem like a shit tongue to other people but we need to understand that if we lose three trades then we essentially lose one hundred dollars okay and we can do the same again let's say we have ten trades that we're limited to before that drawdown target gets hit and boom we lose the account then we have ten where every trade that we take we are essentially risking in real money ten dollars per trade so I'm talking about risk management of like real funds right now not funds within the trading account not funds within the funded account and once you think about it like that and understand I am actually losing money with these FOMO trades with these revenge trades maybe it'll stop you guys from taking more trades in the future and hopefully it does okay so that's the biggest thing within risk management is we just have to take high quality trades and understand that the amount of trades that we have to take are limited and ideally that causes you guys to only take high quality trades only causes you guys to take trades within the high time frame trend or within the high time frame order flow we don't want to be taking trades that are against our strategy that are last minute that are revenge trades those are for another day those for a different time those for are for when we are far better at trading and guess what when you're better at trading you're probably not going to be taking those trades in the first place so we need to limit those now on a live account it's a little bit different we want to understand how to leverage the money in our account to the best of our ability okay and I know you're probably thinking well what does that even mean and there are going to be two things that I want you guys to know and understand your winrate injurist reward if you guys have a high winrate and a low risk reward you guys are going to be slightly higher risk if you guys have a low winrate in a high risk reward you guys are going to be slightly lower risk that's all it is so how is this leveraging the money in our account we are leveraging our money in our account by understanding our own data again why do we journal our trades so that we can collect this data so that we can know how to risk money so again we only have a thousand dollars to our name we prove to ourselves that we are profitable on demo we don't want to go to fund it around because fuck that genuinely fuck that live accounts which is better and again if you guys want to know broker brokerage brokerage I use there's a link in the description but anyways if you guys have a high winrate in a low risk reward and again how do you guys find this out it's by journaling your trades okay and literally figuring out how many times do I win compared to how many times do I lose boom that's your winrate what's my average risk reward per trade boom we can understand if we have a high risk winrate in a low risk reward then we can do a slightly higher risk why because we're winning more way more than we're losing and this is based off so we want slightly higher risk compared to 1% of our account per trade so if we have a one thousand dollar account okay let's say we have a 80% winrate that's really freaking good and a 1 to 1.5 risk reward ratio me personally I would probably be willing to risk like 2 to 3% per trade why because I know that I have a higher winrate and a lower risk reward so when I win I want to be able to capitalize on that high winrate because my risk reward doesn't compensate me enough to just be risking 1% per trade now in the reverse situation with the low winrate in a high risk reward we want to be a slightly lower risk why so we can compensate and understand that hey I'm going to be losing more than I'm going to be winning but when I win I am going to hit big so we have to understand if we're only risking 1% per trade and we have a low winrate in a high risk reward what happens if we lose like 20 trades in a row that's 20 percent of our account balance gone and there are some people and there's some types of traders again it just depends on the type of trader you are and that's why we need to journal but there are some types of traders that do this that do this super low winrate and super high risk reward when they win they win big they have like a 1 to 10 1 to 15 1 to 20 risk reward but they're losing way more trades than they're winning so again depending on the type of trader that that you are that is how you guys are going to be evaluating your risk this also index that's how you guys are going to leverage the money that's in your live day trading account this also applies to funded accounts but to an extent I will say funded accounts are not super duper favorable in either one of these directions it's actually like a mix of both that is favorable because funded accounts or most of them if you lose like a whole bunch of times and then you have one massive win that like instantly passes it for you they're not going to let you pass because they'll have like a consistency rule or something and where like it says like hey you need to be winning more trades you can't just like full port on one single trade and you're like no I didn't full port like that's just my strategy they don't care so boom low winrate and high risk reward that's not going to cut it if we have a high winrate but a low risk reward the the issue that we have here is most most most funded accounts they don't let you do too high of risk so let's say we put a slightly higher risk if we lose like whatever 3% on the day then boom on some platforms that means we only have 1% of the account balance left until we blow the account so again that's why I'm more so in favor of a live account to be able to leverage this statistic because at the end of the day this is how we're going to get the biggest investment turns out of our own personal trading me personally I'm a high winrate in low risk reward person so I have slightly higher risk and I'm on a live account when I did the funded account I honestly was throwing for a bit of a loop I had to do slightly less risk than I usually do on a live account it still ended up working out because I'm going in with the sauce okay so now that we understand risk management and a day trading strategy last but not least we need to understand psychology psychology the three biggest fears that a trader has when within the marketplace and there's there's so much to talk about on psychology and I really just need to make a separate video on it but I'll try and do a small debrief of you guys especially because you guys are dealing with small amounts of money rule number one or fear number one fear of being wrong fear of losing money and fear of missing out these three big fears are the biggest catalyst for traders losing all of their money on their first account now how can we overcome these fears how can we overcome the fear of being wrong what is that that's a confidence issue how do we solve our confidence issue by proving to ourselves that we are profitable for three months fucking straight Timmy really wants to shoot a three pointer but he's never going to be confident in his three point shot until he starts making some fucking shots you guys will never be confident in your trades unless you start winning some fucking trades so your fear of being wrong is always going to be there I always get people asking questions like I get anxious when I enter into a trade how do I fix this bitch more repetitions more work more practice more you need more volume like plain and simple you just need more reps how like how do you think people get big in the gym they don't go to the gym one day and lift one weight and call it a day they go every fucking day and they do more every day you want to get good at trading and you don't want to be anxious or have a fear of being wrong and want to have the utmost confidence in yourself and in your own ability to trade you take more trades and you go until you're really fucking good at it again this is going to take a long time success in trading isn't just a fucking boom watch one tjr video and you're set for life no I want to fully remove that image and picture from your head but the image and picture that I do want to put in your head is five years from now you a profitable day trader who is able to change their life off of one or two of my videos or a whole bunch of my videos because you actually listen to what I said on how long the time frame is going to be and you actually trusted in me because I went down that time frame and I know what you guys should be doing because I've done it before so how do you get rid of the fear of being wrong by winning more trades how do you win more trades by taking more trades how do you take more trades back testing simple fear of losing money that shouldn't be an issue why because we need to be on demo paper trading with no money being risked you should not have the fear of losing money these two go hand in hand you shouldn't have the fear of losing money because there's no money being at risk once you get into a funded account and a live account you still shouldn't have the fear of losing money why because you shouldn't have the fear of being wrong because you proved yourself that you should have the confidence to take those trades last but not least the fear of missing out the fear of missing out is the most bitch shit ever and I'll and I'll solve it with one single statement the market has been here for fucking years what makes you think that today's trade is going to be the last of its kind the market is going to be here tomorrow the market is going to be here the next week the market is going to be here next month stop trying to rush the process the trade that you missed today is going to be here tomorrow and if it's not there tomorrow it's going to be there next week there is always opportunity within the financial markets and you stressing out about missing out on one single trade you are shooting yourself in the foot and you are going to end up taking more losses lose more money and fucking yourself in the butt plain and simple this is it guys TJR is too simple simplicity is what works there's a lovely beautiful saying from I mean literally literally everybody that's a master of their craft if you remove the bullshit and just do what you are supposed to do do what actually works then you will find more success than anybody else in your field I love using basketball analogies if you want to get better at basketball do you do the utmost amount of research on what pair of basketball shoes you should buy or do you go outside and play fucking basketball if you want to get better at basketball you better go fucking play basketball you better not spend five hours researching new basketball shoes this is playing basketball this is day trading that bullshit new confluence that you're trying to learn online is slowing you the fuck down brother and you are shooting yourself in the foot and a lot of people never get past that they never open up their mind to okay I shouldn't be looking for a magic pill that I can swallow to be successful because there's none it doesn't exist the magic pill is the work that you're avoiding the success that you guys are seeking lies in the work that you guys are avoiding to do this is the work work to be profitable on demo on for three months work to be able to be used proper risk management work and challenge yourself to have the discipline to overcome these three fears and you can do all of that before risking money in the markets so now that we have the formula let's let's go over how we can actually mass out our value of our money we kind of already talked about it if you like just being completely honest if you have a thousand dollars and you guys follow this head to freaking toe and then go and put a thousand dollars into a live account that that's it okay that's it fun to account it's a little bit different but it's not that different you're you're limited by the amount of trade or yeah we'll literally break this down right now you're limited by the amount of trades that you have to take so you don't want to go all in on one funded account so let's say that you have a thousand dollars right and there's a maxed out funded account for one thousand dollars or you understand like the way that I trade I am pretty much limited to three or four trades and I don't let I don't like those odds against myself not that I don't that not that I'm doubting myself but genuinely like I may lose four four trades in a row because of my win rate or genuinely like I am just going to need more of a buffer more wiggle room so you need to play with your budget a bit okay you need to look at your win rate look at your risk reward and and genuinely think to yourself okay how many trades will I need to take to be able to pass the funded account given the profit target and given the drawdown moves some of you guys are probably thinking oh it's just gonna be one you know if you have a 10 trade limit and like the drawdown rule is 10% then by all means I think the majority of you guys should be able to pass that account with just like you only need one account but if the drawdown rule is a lot tighter like if it's one of those futures accounts and you only have like four percent drawdown or like three percent drawdown to deal with then that's when that's when she gets a little bit different okay that's when you're probably going to need more wiggle room and you're probably going to want to get maybe two accounts or maybe even three accounts okay so that you guys can give yourself the opportunity not only to play with your within your own win rate and you're within your own risk reward but so that you aren't limiting yourself to the amount of trades that you have to take because if you just max it all out on one funded account it's pretty much saying like yo you just put one thousand dollars on three whole trades like that's not worth it it's not I think about myself back when I was broke back when I was trying to learn how to do this I wouldn't have been able to take that risk while being mentally disciplined and while being like while being emotionally saying okay so this is the top down this is the strategy for you guys I can promise you if you guys follow this and why can I promise you that because I've been in your position before I've been in your position before and I fucking done it before I promise you guys if you guys can just follow this I know you're probably saying it's got to be more than that there's got to be it's not okay you need strategy you need risk management and you need psychology now what I want you guys to understand is this is a long term journey that you guys are going to be going down especially if you guys are new to trading first of all welcome to the day trading community I I'm so glad that you chose me as your mentor but something that I will never lie to you as your mentor about is how difficult this journey is it is not the glitz the glam in the fashion the chains the watch the car I know I show a lot of that in vlogs and stuff but there's a reason why that typically doesn't get shown in these educational videos and that's typically why I get so fucking real with you guys on these educational videos because you guys need to know what trading is about I've been able to build my life off of trading and crypto and all of like just literally a whole bunch of work okay and I can tell you one thing work for a short amount of time never amounts to anything but work over a long period of time with a whole bunch of consistency with a whole bunch of discipline leads to enormous amounts of success and the biggest issue that day traders have is they see this false reality of trading and you know it's it's part of the problem because these myself included like we get massively successful and we obviously are going to enjoy the fruits of our labor but what you guys didn't see was the grind what you guys didn't see was I was in your position before I was broke and I wish that I was able to show that I wish that I could just go back in time and start my social media back from when I was broke to all the way up until now like I wish I had all that whole dirt journey documented so you guys could see this and understand that it's going to take so much longer than you guys think but it is possible and that's what I need you guys to get through your head it is possible and on top of that with the right mentor it's possible like my biggest issue was I was going from mentor to mentor I was jumping from confluence to confluence from strategy to strategy oh this person's teaching this this person's teaching that I didn't know what the fuck to do okay and that that's my goal with this channel that's my goal that was my goal from with social media from the freaking jump was to get on here and teach people how to day trade correctly how somebody in my old broke self's position could be able to succeed and that's that's really what I want to do with you guys okay and if I'm just being like completely honest this one YouTube video isn't going to be able to just like completely change your whole day trading career but what I can do for you is if you guys could just like put some trust in me as a mentor and as a coach I believe that if you guys are able to come to me with personal questions with a whole bunch of other people who are profitable day traders that you guys can ask questions literally on a daily basis with like freaking discord chats okay and say look I'm on my funded account right now and I made this mistake I'm down this much risk and there's myself in there a whole bunch of other coaches that are there that are willing and like literally trying to help you guys excel and get to that level because we know exactly what it's like to be in that position that's what's going to take you guys to the next level and that's what I want to give you guys so again this YouTube video is it great is it a whole bunch of information yes but is it just a generalized overview of what I'm like of just what I'm assuming about all of you guys as unprofitable traders unfortunately yes because I'm unable to answer every single one of you guys's personal questions but I am able to do that within my coaching and within my mentorship so if you guys want to be able to actually get like full full on overview of strategy like literally talk to bottom strategy talk to bottom psychology talk to bottom risk management like this video would literally have to be bro fucking like 30 hours for me to cover everything for you guys to be able to understand everything that day trading in capsules and then on top of that not only do I give you that like for you guys to digest and learn from but you guys get access to me and three other coaches that are profitable and we're just in your guys's position and are passing funded accounts on a daily basis are getting payouts from funded accounts on a daily basis so not only do I know the exact position that you're in but they know the exact position that you're in too and that's like the biggest piece that I wish I had as an unprofitable student as an unprofitable trader was like I had these very personalized questions where I'm like well man within my strategy when this happens and then this happens and then I take this trade like I'm losing or or something happens or it's just like okay well my win rates this my risk rewards this and I can't figure out this those questions can't be answered by YouTube videos the only people that can answer those questions are profitable traders and that's what I want to give to you guys so if you guys want to become my students and if you guys want to have access to me as a coach if you guys want to have access to a whole bunch of other profitable traders that where we not only give you guys like literally top to bottom education from psychology strategy risk management to also getting literally daily freaking calls where you guys can ask us every single one you make you make mistake mistake mistake mistake mistake on Monday you get into the call you can ask all those questions questions resolve boom all of those lessons learned onto the next like do you understand how much of a speed run that is like it's actually so freaking overpowered and it's I am truly super proud of what I have created within my own coaching and that's why I want to offer it to you guys because I know that these YouTube videos they are a help but they aren't like I can only get you so far and I try my best with the YouTube videos but when you guys are able to actually ask me specific personal questions it's like this is a real mistake that you are having that I'm saying boom this is how you solve it and then you get it out of the way and there's only so many of those mistakes that you need to get over until you turn profitable so again that's what I want to offer to you guys it's on an application basis because we can't just take any and everybody okay there's going to be a link in the description if you guys want to apply by all means be my guest if not if these YouTube videos are super helpful for you guys fucking awesome don't don't sign up to my coaching if I and I know there's a whole bunch of people that I've turned profitable just from my YouTube videos and it's like boom you use me as a tool that's what I'm here to be a tool for you guys use me touch me I'm kidding but use me for what I am okay like literally abuse me abuse my YouTube videos go over them over and over and over again if you guys want direct coaching from me use me as a tool to get to your goal you need to see the long-term vision and understand what is it going to take to get to your long-term goal and I can help you guys get there whether it's from YouTube videos whether it's from YouTube videos combined with coaching whatever it may be I'm here to help you guys so as always I appreciate you guys hopefully this is getting you guys one step closer to your goal hopefully this covered a whole lot of mistakes or lessons or things that you guys just didn't even know about day training in the first place again if you guys want to be one of my students there's going to be a link in the description as always I love and appreciate you guys peace the fuck out

=== VIDEO 5/34 : Easiest_Way_To_Start_Day_Trading_From_Scratch_Exactly_What_I_Did-[2zmmjQovPdg].txt
============================================

Trying to start day trading can be super overwhelming and with so many different tips and strategies It's hard to even know where you guys should start So today I'm going to be breaking down the easiest way for you guys to start day trading Even if you guys are a absolute beginner and this is the same approach that took me from struggling It's non-profitable to where I am today consistently They can over six figures a month from trading. So let's dive right in So first and foremost what even is trading? What is day trading? So again, this is something that I'm going to break it down similar to how you're a high school Economic teacher would break this down to you back in the olden days It was a lot more I guess feasible or physical for you guys to be able to understand how trading works now Because it's the digitalized era. It's a little bit more difficult for you guys to understand it So I'm going to take us back into the olden days of how they did trading and they how they did stock trading and investing To give you guys a better understanding of this. So let's take this back to the olden days when computers and phones were not super readily available Or had nearly as much capability as as they do now when I wanted to go by one share of a stock I would have to call up a brokerage or a person that's connected to a brokerage and say hey I want to buy one share of apple stock. Let's say apple didn't exist back then But sure, let's just say hey, I want to buy one share of apple stock. They say okay This is the price of it right now. I can get you the paperwork in a week Okay, and then boom they get the paperwork of your one share of apple stock and then they mail it to you And then you have the paperwork and you're like hey, I own a share of apple Awesome And then if you ever wanted to see what the price point is at you would again still have to go call up the brokerage and say Hey, I'm looking to sell this share of apple stock. What's priced at right now and the brokerage is pretty much doing everything for you They are pretty much the middle man between you and the company that you are investing in And it's the same exact thing as it is today with this online internet money situation with online brokerages But it's just a little bit quicker and a lot smoother where instead of making a phone call and then receiving a piece of paper And then making another phone call we have charts that can tell us the exact price movement at any point in time throughout Every single day within every single second within every single minute of every single day that is happening in real time So we have digitized this and Pretty much the overall goal is to again buy one share or one contract of let's say apple for example Install it for more. Okay, so again, you guys very commonly here Bylow and sell high sounds easy, but it's a lot more difficult than how it sounds Obviously you're going to want to buy low and sell high for a profit But you can also end up taking losses by buying high in selling low Which believe it or not a decent amount of people end up doing that So we want to stay away from that and in this video I'm going to help guide you guys to be able to set yourselves up so you guys don't fall into that trap of Buying high and selling low at least too consistently to the point where you are losing money in trading rather than making money Okay, now to break this down even more so what are we doing within trading This is the way that I like to explain trading a lot of people they get into trading And I'm sure you guys are watching this video right now and you guys are like yeah I can't wait to get into day trading How can I do it and you guys get in and you're like what's trading all about making money And that's where you guys go wrong that is the first and biggest mistake that every single beginner person that's learning Getting into trading that's always their first mistake. They see people like me, you know, whatever got chain I got a nice house. I got some nice cars got some cool watches and they're like hey This guy's making a shit ton of money. I want to make a shit ton of money So I'm going to do what he does and what he does is make a shit ton of money No, you got it twisted. We need to understand the root of what trading is what is trading as a profession Because realistically what are all professions? It is doing an act doing a service doing work to then generate a outcome And then the awesome side effect for ideally most jobs is money involved right So let's think about specifically what are we doing as traders to help us get that awesome side effect of money We are accurately predicting where price wants to go with a high probability So that sounds a little bit more nerdy than just raw raw raw We're making money. That's what trading is all about and realistically if you guys want to get into trading You guys do have to be a little bit more nerdy and you guys do have to get a little bit more Focus and discipline and consistent in order to truly make money from trading This is not for the weak Minded people and this is also not for lazy people I know a lot of people come into these videos because they see in a video of me Driving a three and a half million dollar car and they're like I want to be just like this guy Because he's making a whole bunch of money now I want to make a whole bunch of money too But they aren't willing to put in the work that is required to be able to get there And again, I'm going to lay out a path for you guys to be able to get there But I need you guys to understand that first before we move forward So what is trading about not making money? It's about predicting where they the stock or index or commodity or currency Pairs price wants to go with a high probability keep this in mind We are trading purely off of probability There are days that we lose and there are days that we win our goal is to have a high probability of winning on a daily basis Okay, so somebody like me who makes money from trading I have a high probability of winning Somebody who is brand new to trading and they suck at it They have a low probability of trading okay of being able to predict where price wants to go So what is our goal with trading? How does this profession work? We have a high probability of predicting where price wants to go On a daily basis simple as that we are looking to buy low and sell high with a high probability every single day We are also looking for this is a different concept which is called shorting the market because again This is different than investing then what your grandparents and your parents and all these old people tell you to do invest your money My dollar cost average keep buying off all these assets right yes That's a great strategy when it comes to investing however when it comes to trading There are daily fluctuations and there are daily movements where we are probably not going to want to think and predict that prices only and always going to go up because if price only and always went up every single freaking day Then beautiful we would all be billionaires, but that's not the case right price sometimes has down days Okay, sometimes stocks they go down in price So in order to be able to capitalize on these opportunities to be able to still predict where price wants to go There are short positions which is essentially betting that the stock price the index price the commodity price or the currency pair that you guys are trading Is going to go down in value. So you're probably saying well, how do I make money if it goes down Well, it's quite literally the inverse of buying low and then selling high You are placing a short position. So you are essentially selling Okay, you guys are selling at a higher price and then buying back the contract at a lower price for a profit Okay, and back in the day you couldn't necessarily do this okay, but now with brokerages We are able to do this and they are essentially being the middleman for these transactions So we can say hey look I want to sell this contract of Apple price or this whatever this one stock or this one share of Apple today Because I think that price is going to go down over the next one or two hours, okay? So we short right there and then let's say price does go down over the next one to two hours We buy back that position for a profit because when we shorted it initially We were shorting at a higher price and then we buy it back at a lower price giving us the difference of that equation Which is profit awesome side effect of trading by predicting where price wants to go with high probability money Awesome cool. So now just like the majority of you guys I'm sure that this is going to seem like a super daunting and super difficult skill set to be able to achieve Which it is but as you guys slowly start to progress You guys are going to just like fundamentally and subconsciously Gain and just store all of this information as time goes on where it's going to get to the point where you guys Don't even think about it. I'll be like hey you guys should go long after a sweep of liquidity breaker structure fair value You have getting filled and then enter off of an inverse fair value gap on the one-minute time frame That sounds like a foreign language to you guys right now But to me it's second nature and I'm reading it like the fucking rosetta stone or I'm literally bilingual in English and also trading Okay, so this little guy right here he had no fucking clue what he was getting into when it came to trading and I'm sure just like you guys you guys have been watching hours of these videos We're trying to understand how it goes or maybe to see your first video getting you guys into trading Do not get discouraged because just like you guys I started out with literally no knowledge Okay, and there's a meme that I like to bring up all the time. It's where like this dude in a suit comes in and There's this guy playing the piano and the dude that's standing watching the dude playing the piano He's saying you should stop doing that because you suck and the dude on the piano says well if I stop Then I won't get good and it's the same exact thing with trading where if you guys want to or if you guys give up Then you guys won't get any better obviously or if you guys stop you guys won't get any better and on top of that If you guys don't start if you guys don't take action and if you guys don't actually make an attempt Then you won't get any better So we need to keep that in our heads when we are getting into this super daunting super high skill level or super high-tiered skill that is day trading got a lot of people really wish to attain But not many people can attain it so again like I was saying earlier on you guys need to have discipline And you guys need to have consistency in order to make this work on top of that I lost a shit ton of money when getting into trading because I didn't understand basic fundamentals And I got roped into a whole bunch of these other things that I'm going to explain later in this video that hopefully I can tell you guys about so you just can avoid losing all the money that I lost when I was first getting into trading And on top of that what even brought me into trading in the first place It was the same exact thing that brought you guys to this video I was seeing a whole bunch of people who were making a shit ton of money and I was like hey I want to make money and at the time it was like at a pivotal point in my life where I was like Hey, it's time to start applying to colleges. Hey, what do you want to do in college? I don't freaking know. I just know I want to make a bunch of money I also don't want to work a job where a boss has it bossing me around And I also don't want to work a nine to five and I was having these thoughts at a very young age Which again kind of signal to me that hey, I knew that I was going to be an entrepreneur At least at that point in time I didn't realize that that was going to lead me to be in the position that I am today But I had those thoughts and I'm sure a lot of you guys are having those thoughts right now Whether you guys are in high school or in college or past college to the point where you guys are like Hey, I hate this job that I'm in or I don't fucking know what I want to do with my life And I think trading is interesting I want to be my own boss and I want financial freedom And that was the exact same position that I wasn't I didn't necessarily know what I wanted to do with my life And I just knew that I wanted to make money on my own and be able to live a financially free life And that is what wrote me into trading because initially before that I was like I don't know what I'm going to do with my future And that is what brought me into trading and then after that I got super super enticed and fell in love with being able to predict price action with a high probability on a daily basis I treated it like a game and it turned my life Completely around and been able to make me financially free and become the man that I always wanted to become at that point in time in my life And my goal with this video is to help you guys do the same So now let's get into the actual tools and things that are going to benefit you guys when it comes to starting out and trading This is going to be your biggest and most beneficial tool which is going to be the charts themselves So this is a website called trading view you guys can sign up for absolutely free and be able to look at all of these different stock prices right now I'm on the Nasdaq we can look at the S&P 500 prices. Okay, let me remove my drawings So it's a little bit less daunting, but trading view.com write it down You guys can sign up for absolutely 100% free This is where you guys are going to be able to see what certain things are going to be worth and where you guys are going to start developing the skill set of strategy and understanding where price is going to go I know that when you guys look at this chart, you're like holy shit. What the fuck is going on? This is super super scary Yes, I understand that but the first thing that we need to do is at least even make an attempt to be able to get on here and then get comfortable With seeing these things. Okay, because again when it comes to a high level skill set such as this Obviously, this is going to be super daunting at first, but now I'm at the point where hopefully you guys will be able to get there Get to the same point as me where I look at this chart and I'm no longer scared of it Instead, I'm using it as a tool and using it to my advantage to be able to predict where price wants to go I'm able to look at the several different time frames that are on here right now. We're on the four-hour time frame Each candlestick represents four hours worth of time and four hours worth of price action Meaning that within these four hours for so from six a.m. This morning all the way till 10 a.m. price ended up going down Around 0.81 percent again. I know this seems a little bit scary for you guys But the very first thing that you guys are going to want to do is to be able to get on trading view and that's that's really it That's the only tool that I want you guys to get on here at first to start playing around with and start looking at Again, we can look at all these different charts. We have the Bitcoin chart right now Bitcoin We can look at the price on the right hand side Okay, we can change the time frame that we're looking at so if we click this M button We're looking at now. Hey, this is what a month's worth of price action is looking like or what a month's worth of price movement is looking like on the Higher time frames if we're looking at the grander scheme of things we can see hey man over the course of a long period of time Bitcoin has consistently gone up Being able to understand these tools is super beneficial or specifically trading view in the charts itself It's going to be very beneficial for your guys is trading journey So I highly recommend you guys go sign up for an account on trading view like I said It's completely free you guys can go on there and you guys can start at least just looking at these different charts and getting comfortable Cycling through some of these time frames. Okay. I'm not necessarily going to tell you guys Exactly how to break down every single thing and how you guys can make a shit ton of money off of this right now Because you guys are in the super early phases of just understanding trading So just for now I want you guys to get comfortable with our biggest and best tool when it comes to being able to predict price Because this is how we're able to actually see the prices on a daily basis within every second of the day We can see that these prices are consistently moving if we go down to these lower lower time frames We can see that hey each one of these little candlesticks on the chart is representing one minutes One minute worth of price movement within each second so we can see boom Bitcoin's price just went down a little bit It just went from around 100 in $9,268 down to $109,200 and two dollars how can we capitalize on a position like that maybe by going short? Okay, it obviously is going to take a lot more than that and a lot more understanding than just saying hey We're just going to press short like I talked to you guys about earlier in this video But getting comfortable with seeing these things is going to be super beneficial and just again Getting into it and getting used to using these tools go ahead click around on some of these buttons again I don't want to go fully in-depth on all of these things just yet But getting comfortable seeing these candlesticks printing Cycling through the time frames and at least getting on the charts is your first step to be able to start slowly Digesting this big skill of trading now the next thing I want to talk to you guys about when it comes to understanding the skill of day trading Is some of these mistakes that I fell into when I was early and trying to understand trading and hopefully this is going to save you guys Years if not months of time in Going and turning from an unprofitable trader into a profitable trader that's able to predict Where price action wants to go the high probability on a daily basis first and foremost is there is a lot of miss and bad Information out there on the internet and I know it's difficult right now in these early phases to be able to siphon through a lot of the Crazy and elaborate information that's out here on all of these different side hustles But the goal is for you guys to find somebody that is on the internet showing you guys a bunch of proof of them Actually making money in trading and then trusting those people and learning from these people who are actually showing you guys Full-fledged proof of them being profitable. So for example, I mean obviously I'm going to reference myself But you guys can look at my Instagram stories every single day I'm posting my pnl on the day. I'm posting my pnl for that week I'm posting my pnl for the month and I'm showing you guys full transparency of whether I won whether I lost If I didn't trade for that day and then on top of that I'm pressing record every single market open on these trade recaps that you guys might see through my youtube channel And you guys will see me actually walking through in-depth of why I'm taking the trades that I'm doing and then also telling you guys Exactly when I enter and exactly when I exit Okay, and this is the level of transparency that you guys need to find from somebody that is willing to teach you guys the skill of trading Or else, you know if they're not showing you guys daily weekly monthly pnl's while also showing the trades the exact trades that they're taking I hate to break it to you bro, and you guys should probably try and learn from somebody else So by all means I'm not telling you guys specifically that you guys can only learn from me But I'm saying you guys should find somebody with the level of proof and level of expertise that I give and I show Within my youtube channel to be able to vet out some of these people Okay, because again within the online money space that we're in now especially within trading There's a lot of deceit and a lot of lies that goes on so again find somebody that shows shit to an approved of their product And of what they do on a daily basis so you guys can learn from the right people the second thing is Understanding your emotions when it comes to trading okay, like I said a lot of you guys are getting into trading Not necessarily to be able to understand where price wants to go with high probability on a daily basis You guys are like I just want to make a shit ton of money problem with that headspace If I just want to make a shit ton of money is you are going into trading with the wrong idea Okay, because if you're thinking I just want to make a shit ton of money every single day That's a relatively good headspace to be in but we need to change our goal there instead of just saying I want to make a shit ton of money because we as humans naturally have a very strong emotional connection to money And as you guys will eventually know when you guys are getting into trading We need to fully remove our emotions from trading because if we get greedy in trading We are going to be taking trades that we shouldn't be we're going to be risking too much money And then what happens if we lose that trade we're losing money that we weren't willing to risk in the first place We sometimes can get fearful we can sometimes lack confidence We can sometimes be a little bit overconfident So instead of prioritizing our emotions and acting emotionally we need to be data driven Okay, when we get into the markets and again as you guys go through this day trading Journey of you guys learning how to trade you guys are going to learn these Super valuable skill sets of prioritizing your psychology and prioritizing the data that is put in front of you Such as the charts like actually reading the charts instead of just saying oh my goodness Price is going up so fast right now. I'm just gonna press buy and trust me I've been in that situation before the second that you press buy the charts going to go down and you're going to lose Fucking money. So don't fall into that trap. I know it's difficult for you guys to do it right now But again, keep it in the back of your mind where you guys can constantly be thinking Am I making a decision based off my emotions and based off how I'm feeling or am I making a decision based off the data That's presented to me. Okay, and then lastly something that's going to help you guys again speedrun two Profit abilities by setting yourself goals you guys have to aim towards something and you guys again Can't really shoot at anything you guys can't shoot at something without a target. Okay, so for me This is actually my old journal when I first started getting into trading and I would write down like pretty much everything Okay, I'll write down you see this. I'll write down my trading plan again like I went in crazy depth Okay, I have another thing right here that says trading plan my goals all of these things are Super beneficial and then I'll write down and journal like boom first week of August Okay, I'm writing down all of these things what price was doing and I was also writing down my goals and aspirations on this To be able to progress me to where I wanted to go because again if you guys don't set goals Then how are you even supposed to know what steps you're going to take in order to get to where you want to go Okay, so we all have this overall super vague goal of I want to turn profitable I want to make a whole bunch of money trading. Okay, that's awesome But what is a subset of goals that we can set that can help us make daily decisions or take daily action to get closer to that over arching Massive goal of I want to turn profitable and I want to make money trading Okay, so that's going to be stick to the strategy that we know and understand Follow a risk management plan don't let emotions get the best of us. Okay, we want to start swapping out some of the bad habits that we have Even as just humans like I'm sure a lot of you guys probably have a lot of bad habits And the second that I said that I'm sure you guys thought of a couple bad habits that you guys have Whatever those habits are that you just thought of you guys immediately need to kick them because in order for us to be successful in discipline Within trading we also need to be successful in discipline within our own lives Because what makes you think that you're going to be able to be disciplined in one facet of your life If you're not disciplined in the rest of it. It's just not possible. So we need to again Set these goals to one excel us as humans, but also as traders now Let's get into how I actually became profitable. So first and foremost Yeah, like I know it sounds stupid, but you guys have to lock in okay I realized that I wasn't where I wanted to be in life So I had to make a big personal decision that hey I'm going to have to give up all of these bad habits that are causing me temporary joy and temporary rewards That usually lasts only like an hour or two hours or daily little things that are causing me to not get to where I want to go And I need to start prioritizing goals and prioritizing actions that maybe they're difficult to do today And tomorrow and every single day consistently But those goals and those things that I'm doing consistently on a daily basis are going to help me get to my final and end goal And that's what you guys need to start doing is realizing that hey if you guys truly do want to make money with trading And you guys want to lock in and actually make this big decision and make this dedication to your life to be able to do this for like a full-time job You have to treat it like a full-time job It's not just some side thing that you guys are going to learn on the side and spend 30 minutes or an hour each day learning No, it's going to take a lot more than that because again if a regular person who has bad habits and who is living super comfortably and who is Undisciplined was able to learn how to day trade than every single person would be rich But that's not the case on top of that. What did I have to do? I had to change the mindset that I was in so I had to start thinking with a different mindset and a different point of view of my life Instead of thinking how can I make a bunch of money today? I had to start thinking years in advance. I just start thinking what can I do today that is going to set me up for a better life Five years from now because if we think of our massive timeline of life No matter where you guys are are right now whether you guys are in high school whether you guys are in college Whether you guys are out of college you guys are still in these early phases of life Where if you guys are able to develop this skill of trading it can drastically affect and change what your life trajectory is going to look like in the future whereas if you guys keep doing these bad habits and keep Living the same exact life that you guys are right now nothing is going to change a quote that I love it sounds stupid But it's real nothing changes if nothing changes So right now if you guys are like yes, I want to learn how to day trade But then you don't change anything within your life or change anything within your headspace of how you're thinking about doing things or how you're going Going to start taking action being disciplined being consistent Then nothing's going to change if you guys like what makes you think that you guys are going to become successful in a skill set That is very difficult to attain by being just a normal human by being average We aren't trying to be average. We're trying to be way above average and we're trying to live a life that 99% of people aren't able to get so in turn what do we have to do? We have to do what 99% of people aren't willing to do okay And that's the headspace that you guys have to get in and that's the headspace that I had to put myself in again when I was writing down These notes like these are affirmations that I would reach myself every day that we're not true at the time But now I've fully surpassed these things and I'm literally getting goosebumps thinking about it every time I read these things It's like just so crazy how far I've come in my life But I will make $10,000 a month. I am successful. I will follow my trading plan. I will follow my schedule I will log my trades. I will invest money into crypto. That's that one was crazy. That one helped change my life forever I am successful in the markets. I make money in the markets. I am not greedy. I'm unbiased I'm confident in my markups and my layouts my mindset is always leveling up Life goals. I will make $1 million in a year some months. I'm making a million dollars now and at the time When I was writing these I was like bro, I would be fucking lucky I would be the luckiest person in the world to be able to make a million dollars in a year Here I am doing those numbers in a month. I will be financially free. I will own a Lamborghini I never ended up owning a Lamborghini, but hey at least it's the thought that counts I own a Coney Zeg now which is three and a half million dollars instead I will be mentally and physically healthy. I will travel frequently I will enjoy my life because that is what we are here to do I will continue to level up my mindset These are things that I was writing when I was at the lowest point in my life I was not making any money. I was depressed. I didn't necessarily have any friends to talk to I did not have a good relationship with my parents at this point in time And the only person that I had was myself And I'm sure a lot of you guys are in that position right now Trading not only helped change my life financially but helped change my life mentally And it all started with believing what was possible before I could even taste what it was like I was writing these goals down just off of like hopes in fucking dreams bro And now rereading these it's it's just so crazy how I was able to Manifest the life that I'm living by just working every single fucking day towards this goal that I had Or towards all these goals that I had and it was just a relentless Consistent fucking grind that was very difficult But now just a couple years later I'm able to look back and I'm able to read these things and I'm like holy shit I did it and I know that every single one of you guys has this potential in you I'm a regular as person bro like there's nothing that I've done in my life that you guys can't do like I really am no different than any of you guys like I truly am just a normal fucking human being and All it takes is for you to see the potential in yourself all it takes is you guys just believing that you guys can do it And then just putting your head down and saying shut the fuck up to every single person That's saying that you can't do it and saying shut the fuck up to the voices in your head Because guess what you're already in a shitty position anyways So me personally I would rather work my ass off to be able to get out of that shitty position In worst case I stay in that same exact position that I'm in but at least I fucking tried And I'm telling you guys right now without a doubt in my fucking mind that if you guys put in the work required And if you guys put your head down and say shut the fuck up to every single person That is getting on you or making fun of you for fucking trying that you guys will be able to make it That's all that it takes in order to be successful It's just consistent hard work with discipline and that's really what's going to separate you from everybody else The majority of people are lazy they're complacent They don't want to do anything with their lives and Me when I was trying to learn how to trade I was not satisfied with the life that I was living And I wanted more for myself you guys are watching this video because you guys want more for yourselves You guys want to change your lives you guys wouldn't be watching this video if that wasn't the case And that tells me that you guys see potential in yourself to be living a better life than you guys have right now And that is what's going to be your driver of success and never lose side of that now I know I just went on a really long S rant But all of that is super true now getting back more so into the trading side of things is Strategy so I'm sure a lot of you guys are going to stumble across a whole bunch of these different strategy videos There's five minute strategies going to give you an 80% win rate and make you $5,000 every single day consistently Okay, that's some bullshit if you guys ever see that online literally like just block them and something that I fell into It's a trap that you guys always see on social media is this new strategy This is what you guys are missing that's going to turn you successful in trading This one confluence is going to help you be able to do no it's not what is going to help you guys turn profitable in trading Finding a mentor that again shows as much proof as possible to be able to show you guys that hey They are actually making money doing this on top of that Finding a strategy that not only makes sense to you But is used by somebody that is successful in the markets using that strategy and sticking to it Okay, the amount of months if not like a full year that was wasted from me Because I was jumping from strategy to strategy to strategy because a new YouTube video would come up on my recommended feed Was just ridiculous bro. I wasted a month if not a full year because I was like hey this strategy video that I saw online Is gonna turn me profitable and then I took one trade using that strategy and then I lost it and I was like this guys are fucking liar I'm going to the next one and it's like no if LeBron James teaches you how to shoot a basketball and you take your first shot and you miss Is LeBron James a liar or are you just not good enough at shooting a basketball yet? It's the second one. So again, we need to understand that developing these skill sets is going to take some time Okay, and strategies one of the biggest skill sets and that's where we're going to be applying these deals on the charts Understanding where and how price is going to move okay, and just find one that makes sense to you That makes sense to why price is moving the way that it does and then awesome whether it's my strategy Whether it's somebody else on the internet strategy. I don't care Find one and stick to it and then learn it and develop into a high skilled trader using just that strategy Trust me. There's no other YouTube video strategy that's going to get you whatever It's some better returns than a different strategy. Okay, there's so many in it. It's actually ridiculous How many online internet gurus that get on to Whatever YouTube video and they're like this person's a liar this strategy doesn't work. Okay. I have so many rich Trader friends that aren't even online and they trade in ways that are way different than me Realistically every single trader trades differently. Okay, that's just that's just the reality of it There's not one strategy that fits on there's not one strategy that works and one strategy that doesn't okay You just need to find a strategy that makes sense to you on why price is moving and then practice it and practice it on the charts Like relentlessly with discipline and with consistency. Okay, and that leads into risk management which is another portion of this so so far we've covered two of the three tiers of trading Okay, and you're probably saying okay, what are the three tiers of trading the three tiers of trading are the three fundamental skills That are going to turn you guys profitable. It's understanding a strategy understanding your emotions So psychology and then risk management risk management and psychology kind of go hand in hand because risk management It's actually pretty easy. It's just deciding hey, how much money do I want to risk on a daily basis? Boom pretty freaking simple right the hard part is sticking to that and by overcoming those emotional challenges That you guys faced when it comes to risking those amounts of money So like I said at the beginning of this video all of you guys are getting into trading because Rarararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararar We don't trade with our emotions, again, that's when we fall into these emotional traps, we are no longer thinking with the data that's presented to us. We're thinking with, oh no, prices going higher and higher, I want to also get into this. I'm going to press buy and then boom, you end up losing all your money. And then, oh no, my trade is going in the opposite direction, but I'm just going to get rid of my stop loss and not sell because I think my direction was right for the day and then guess what? You end up losing all of your money. So, by trading with these emotions or by letting your emotions take over the logic when it comes to trading, that's how you guys are going to break that risk management and risk management, like I said, is essential in order to turn profitable. Number two is just be patient. Like I said, day trading is a very high barrier of entry skill set. Day trading is very difficult to understand and trust me, it is going to be a long and difficult journey, but that journey is going to be a small tiny blip of the time. So, again, you guys aren't going to get rich as quick as you think with trading, but you guys aren't going to get rich quick, or I would like to say that if you guys are consistent and stick with this enough, that disclaimer, not all of you guys are going to get rich quick, okay? But if you guys are consistent with this, if you guys are disciplined with this, I know that you guys will eventually be able to make money from the markets, but you just have to be patient in understanding that this is a much longer timeline than you guys are expecting it to be, okay? And then last but not least, it's as simple as just sticking to your plan, sticking to your strategy, like we mentioned before, sticking to the data that's presented to us, and then understanding the risk management plan that we've set up, okay? Now, I want to go over your guys' next steps or how to move forward from here. So, you guys understand what trading is, by the way, sell high, make money, sell high, by the way, make money. You guys know the three pillars of trading, which is psychology, risk management, and strategy, you guys know relatively the overall gist of them, okay? So, in this psychology, we don't want to fall into the emotional traps that trading can bring us strategy, we want to choose one that makes sense to us, that can help us understand where price wants to go, and ideally we have a high probability of doing it, and then risk management, we're not over risking, we're having a sustainable risk management plan. We are ready for losses when they do come, because they will come within trading, and also where it going to be able to capitalize more on our wins, our ideal situation is to maximize wins and minimize losses. So, your guys' next steps is taking action today and not tomorrow, and what I want to invite you guys to is my three-day live event that I'm going to be doing from November 8th through the 10th, where I'm going to be covering all three of these pillars of day trading in complete depth. It's going to be a several multi-hour live educational event where I'm teaching you guys literally everything A to Z when it comes to trading, so I'm going to be going over strategy in depth, how you guys can understand those very intimidating and daunting charts that I showed you guys early on, okay? Okay, where I'm going to show you guys how to understand candlesticks, how to build out a strategy, how to understand where price is going to go at certain times, off of certain confluences, I'm going to teach you guys the confluences, and then furthermore I'm going to give you guys an in-depth strategy on how you guys can fortify your guys' psychology, so you guys don't fall into those emotional traps within trading, so you guys can, again, turn yourself not only into a successful trader, but also into a successful person, and then we are also going to be covering risk management within that threshold. So, I'm going to be doing some management within that three day live event. Again, this is going to be, this is the first time that I'm doing something like this, and I think it's going to be some of the most value that I've ever given to the internet, like literally ever, and I'm going to be doing it live in front of you guys, I'm going to be spending literally my entire weekend dedicated to this for you guys, so that you guys are going to be able to turn profitable and have the exact roadmap so you guys are able to, again, get on this right track of turning profitable. I'm going to leave a link down in the description for you guys to sign up to this, and again, I want you guys to start taking action today, so this YouTube video is a perfect step, and then on top of that, if these are whatever, if you guys are watching this YouTube video, while the event is still like a month out or a couple weeks out, that's awesome. You guys can start front loading and start watching a whole bunch of my YouTube videos, and on top of that, when you guys actually join the three day live event, you guys are going to be put in a special crew chat, where I'm going to be sending you guys videos prior to the event, so you guys can mentally prepare, we're going to be going over some psychological tips. So, we're giving you guys even more value once you guys join to, again, prep you guys for this massive three day event that we're doing to help you guys understand how to trade from literally A to Z, how to build out those massive three skill sets. And again, the next step for you guys is to start taking action today. You guys got on this video because you guys want to become a successful day trader. There's a reason why you clicked on this video, it's because you guys see more potential in yourself than what you guys are currently at right now. I advise you guys, and I want to encourage you guys to take action today, whether it's watching another YouTube video after this, whether it's signing up to the three day live event, doing something that is going to put yourself in a better position to be able to get one percent better by tomorrow. Okay, whether it's just completing this YouTube video and then taking notes and then watching another one right after this, keep taking actions that are going to help you guys get towards that end goal, whether it's signing up for the three day live event, and then going over the YouTube videos and the videos that I personally send you guys within that group, whatever it is, I want to tell you guys to start taking action today because tomorrow's going to come and then you guys are going to be like, oh, man, I'll do it the next day. I'll do it the next day. In that mindset is never going to get you guys anywhere. The second thing that I want you guys to do is understand your guys' timeline, understand that this is going to take a decent amount of time for you guys to learn and for you guys to develop this skill set, but trust me, it is going to be the smallest blip on your timeline of understanding or learning how to trade. And that little blip on your timeline can drastically affect and change what the rest of your life is going to look like. So again, strongly advise you guys to, again, understand the potential that you guys have and take action and take some initiative to change the way that your life can look like by doing something today and then doing something tomorrow and then the following day, every single day to help get you guys to where you guys want to go, just like how I did back when I was writing this journal, I was not successful at all when I was writing this journal. And now I've fully surpassed all of the goals that I wrote down in this journal just a couple years later. That is 100% possible for you guys. And again, just understanding that timeline of, is this going to be a very difficult skill to learn? Yes, but also understanding that if you guys are able to learn it and if you guys are disciplined and consistent enough that this can change your life forever. And then last but not least is just reinforcing that fact that consistency beats everything. Okay, literally just showing up on a daily basis, whether you want to or whether you don't and at least putting in some effort, taking a little bit of action every single day is going to help you guys get towards that end goal. Because if you guys put in whatever you guys watching this YouTube video and then you're like, I don't really want to do this. And then a week goes by and then you watch another YouTube video and you're like, okay, I do want to do this. You just wasted a week's worth of time when that entire week you guys could have been getting 1% better. You literally could have already been 10% better than you were a few just were consistent. So the people that show up every single day are going to get so much further than the people that aren't doing things consistently on a daily basis. And that's the last thing that I want to leave you guys with is whether you guys do something after this YouTube video or not. I'm going to make a promise to you guys is that every single person that stays consistent and stays disciplined, you guys are going to be a winner. Whether that means in trading or just in life and whether you guys want to pursue trading or end up giving up on it and finding another side hustle, I don't give a crap. Okay, I just want as many people that come through this video to be as successful as possible. That is my goal with my YouTube channel for you guys to come here and for me to inspire the people that were just like me when I first started trading to be able to help them to get to where they want to go with their lives because I know when I was younger, I was struggling and I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life and then I just so happened to stumble across a day trading video just like this and it changed my life forever. And I want you guys to realize the potential that you guys have as human beings and where you guys can go with your life and I'm sure you guys already know what you guys can do with your lives because you already clicked on this video. So again, if you guys want to start taking action today, I highly advise you guys to sign up to that three day live event that I'm going to be doing. Again, it's going to be hours worth of information. I'll leave a link down in the description for that. And then again, if it's a couple whatever like a couple weeks away or a month away, I advise you guys to watch another YouTube video whether it's mine or somebody else's. I don't I really don't care. I just want you to again keep taking steps in the right direction. So with that being said, I love and appreciate you guys. Drop a sub. Peace out.

=== VIDEO 6/34 : Fair Value Gaps Explained-xcDOMKaOIsk.txt
============================================

This is going to be the only fair value gap video that you guys need to watch in order to fully understand fair value gaps imbalances and inverse fair value gaps. I'm going to be covering how to identify them, how to use them on a chart, and also when we can use them to actually take trades off of them. Obviously we need a lot of other influences to actually take these trades, but this is mainly just going to be going over imbalances a whole, which is fair value gaps imbalances, and inverse fair value gaps. So with that being said, let's jump on the chart, let's talk about how to identify them, and then also make sure you guys stay to the end so that I can show you guys not only how to identify them, but how to actually place trades using this super great confluence that I pretty much use every single day in order to place trades. So let's pull up the chart. Before we even start doing anything with handle sticks or anything, we're going to do a Picasso drumming. So a fair value gap, and something that I like to do is I like to help people fully understand the confluence, so we want to be able to not only be able to identify it, but know why we're using it in the first place, because if we're just placing on a trade just saying like, oh yeah this happens, so I'm going to place a trade, there's not much confidence in that. Me personally, I like to have like a crazy amount of confidence when I'm going into a trade, and in order for me to have a crazy amount of confidence going into a trade, I need to fully understand the confluence that I'm taking that trade off of, or else why the fuck would I be confident in it? I need to know why price is moving. So first I'm going to show you guys how we can identify them, I'm going to give you guys a little drawing of it, and then we're going to go ahead and describe why price moves the way that it does off of these confluences, and then we'll go into identifying them. So a fair value gap is a three candlestick pattern. Okay, we have one candle, and then we have our expansion candle, and then we have another candle. So as we know, anatomy of candlesticks, we have, boom, this candle opened right here, it had by orders that pushed it up here, and then sell orders, push price down here, and at one point in time price came down here. At one point in time price came up here, sell orders ended up pushing price down and closing price out right here. Then following that, we see a boom, big move up. So this candle set closes up here. Next, this candlestick opens right here at one point in time during this, let's say this is this is on the hour, okay? So during this hour, our price got up to this point, price at sell orders down to this point, and then buy orders, push it back up, and then price ended up closing here. So this is a bullish fair value gap, or where even is the fair value gap in the first place? Well, we know that price had by orders pushed it up here, and then what happened? Sell orders were right here in cause price to push down, okay, and ended up stopping it right here. Then on top of that, we had sell orders pushed price down, and then buy orders bought it back up here. So what do we know? Sell orders stop here and sell orders stop here. So with that in mind, what do we know? Sell orders stopped here and sell orders stopped here. So what is there a lack of within this gap? There's a lack of sell orders. So this is part of the reasoning behind this. When we have this gap between the top candlestick of the first candle, in the bought candlestick of the third candle, we can identify a price range where there's a lack of sell orders within the market. That if the market retraces into it, and we see buy orders filled within that price range where there's a lack of sell orders, what can we assume about price prices more than likely going to proceed up, especially if we're within an uptrend? Okay, so that's a bullish fair value gap. Why is it a bullish fair value gap? Well, first of all, if we're in an uptrend, and we see a price range where there's a lack of sell orders and price goes into the price range where there's a lack of sell orders, and we see candlesticks moving up out of that confirming that buy orders have been filled. And then we can safely assume that price is going to move higher from there. And on top of that, why do we call these imbalances? Why do we call fair value gaps imbalances in the first place? Because it's imbalanced price action. We know that there's a lack of sell orders within here. So what is going to cause price to balance itself out, sell orders to push price down in here, fill in this lack of sell orders. And then from there, we can get buy orders out of that. And that's going to cause price to move higher. And more often than not, we see these imbalances get filled in order to balance out price action. And I'm going to show you guys how you guys can identify order flow and how you guys can identify which fair value gaps are going to get filled and which ones are going to be filled more likely than others on the chart. Okay, so I'm going to be explaining that later in the video. So make sure you guys stay along for this. Next one, we're going to be identifying a bearish fair value gap bullish means up bearish means down for all the noobs. Okay, so bearish fair value. Yeah, we have boom. And also keep in mind these three candlestick patterns, the first candle and the third candle, it does not matter the color of them. We don't see color. We don't care if the candle is red, green, black, fucking Indian, okay, it doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter the colors of these these these candlesticks, the only color that matters, the only discrimination that we do is on on the middle one. Okay, so this one can be an Indian candlestick. It doesn't matter. Okay, it can be up down all around. Okay, as long as this one is going down and as long as we make a gap within this for bearish the bottom of the first candle on the top, we have the third candle, then what do we know about this price range right here? It's imbalance why because there's a lack of now by orders within here. So if price wants to come in and fill in this price range to balance out that price action to come into the imbalance price action where there's a lack of buy orders and then we see sell orders come out of that. What is price more likely going to do probably going to continue down from there. Okay, so that is our three candlestick pattern. Okay, we know that there's a lack of sell orders within a bullish for value gap. We know that there's a lack of buy orders within a bearish for value gap. Cool, cool, cool, cool. Again, we don't care about the colors of the first candlestick or the third candlestick, the only one that we care about is the middle candlestick, whether it's going up or whether it's going down. Now, that's how we identify what a fair value gap is. What happens when we're trying to identify if there isn't a fair value gap. Well, it's super simple. If the wicks of the first candlestick and the third candlestick overlap, then we know there's not an imbalance there. So let's say this candlestick's got a huge wick up and this candlestick's got a huge wick down. Is there an imbalance within here? No, even though this candlestick is freaking huge. There's no imbalance within here. Why? Because we know that sell orders stopped all the way up here. Buy orders, push it up and then sell orders were able to come in up here and push price down. Same thing here. On this third candlestick sell orders came down here. So these sell orders are overlapping and now there's not a imbalance and there's not a price range where there's a lack of sell orders. So in turn, there's no imbalance. Same thing here on this bearish fair value gap. If we have buy orders, sell orders, push this down, buy orders, buy it back up, buy orders, push price up. If we see something like this, there's no imbalance. There's no price range where there's an it where there's a lack of buy orders. So in turn, this is not a bearish for value gap. If the wicks of the first candle and the third candle are overlapping, there's no fair value gap. They're like just think of the name. It's a gap. We can see the gap. Boom. It's right here gaping hole. We want to plunge it. Okay. So now that we know how to identify fair value gaps. Let's go ahead and look at them on the chart. There's this is something that I need you guys to understand. Don't just watch up to this point in the video and be like, boom, TJ, talk me how to do a fair value gap. I'm going to place a buy every time it comes into this fair value gap. And I'm going to be quite brilliant. Air. No, Timmy, you're actually going to be retarded and homeless if you do that. Okay. We need to use a lot more confluences combined with this in order to be good at trading. Okay. So this is just one of the confluences and later down the line, maybe in like a week or so, I'm going to make a full YouTube video going over my whole strategy on how I look to take trades and it's going to be like fucking three to four hours long going over all this shit. But we need to understand that we can't just be buying and selling every single time we come into a bullish or bearish for value gap. We need a lot more confluences with that. We need daily bias. We need liquidity. We need inverse for value gaps. We need break of structure. We need order blocks break of blocks. All that good shit. Okay. But this is just one piece of the puzzle. So with that being said, let's go ahead and identify it on the chart. Now, like I said, there's a whole bunch of these things and they're all over the chart. So instantly, we need to be like a fucking tracker, Jack, or we need to be able to have aim bot. Okay. When I get on the chart instantly, what am I seeing? I'm seeing boom, bearish for value gap. Boom, bearish for value gap. Okay. And then eat and then within here, what do we have? Boom, bullish for value gap. And then boom. Okay. This is something that I need to explain to you. Let me get rid of all these other fair value gaps. Sorry. I'm going a little bit too fast, but that just shows how good I am at trading. Okay. Something I want you guys to understand. This is probably the best analogy that I have ever made in trading ever. Fair value gaps are like dicks. Size does not matter. We can have the girthiest, longest, biggest fair value gap in the world. And price will probably want it. You know, at the end of the day, it's a big one. We probably want that one. Right? It's a big imbalance. We want it. But also a little guy, a two incher, even a micro pin, it can do the job as long as we get in there. It's we're making shit shake. And we got to think from the woman's perspective, a penis is just one piece of the puzzle. A penis is just one adaptation to the full romantic embodiment of a man. So we need to be thinking about not just the penis, but we need to be thinking about what lies within the personality. And that's the second piece of it. What lies within a fair value gap in imbalance? What lies within a man personality? So they're seeking not penises. They're seeking and yearning for human connection. They're yearning for a personality that they can bond with. And it's the same thing with fair value gaps. When we get on to the chart, we know that the chart, it's not just seeking and looking for the biggest dick out there. It's looking for that imbalance. That's all it wants. It just wants a connection. So if we see a little guy versus a big guy, we're not discriminating. Both of them can be filled. They're both valid. Why? Because it's what lies within. It's that personality. It's that imbalance. Size does not matter. Okay. So with that being said, let's pull up this example here. So let's look at this. This little guy right here, this is an imbalance. Why? You guys are probably saying TJR. You're so dumb, bro. We want the big daddy. We want we want Drake. This is Drake. Okay. We want Drake. Well, bro, what about little Timmy? What about TJR? This little guy can do the trick too. And we saw, we can see he did the trick. This imbalance got filled and we saw a bullish, we saw a bullish reaction off of it. Then again, Drake comes and fuck like just leaves a gaping hole in that bitch. But okay, wow, we're getting off track here. Wait, I'm getting distracted. But you guys get the point. Size doesn't matter. If even if it's the littlest fair value gap, it still matters. Okay. So this is a good example of a bullish fair value gap. Where is our three candlestick pattern? We have our first candlestick. Where's the topwick right here? Third candlestick move up. Again, the color, we don't see color. Okay. The third candlesticks, WIC is right here. These two WICs don't overlap. We leave a bullish fair value gap right here. Price comes in, fills the bullish fair value gap. And then we get a bullish reaction out of it. Obviously, if we had went long off of this, like Drake's coming through and swinging his shade on top of our forehead. But again, that's why we need several other confluences. All we want to do right now is just to be able to identify them. So again, where's our fair value gap? First candle, second candle, third candle. These WICs, they don't overlap. This is a bearish fair value gap. First candle, second candle, third candle. This third candle doesn't even have a WIC, but it's still considered as a fair value gap. Boom. First candle, boom. This is a bearish fair value gap. Let's show an example of what a fair value gap is not. Okay, let's see price right here. We have first candle, second candle, third candle. What do we see? The top WIC of the first candle, the bottom WIC of the third candle. These two WICs are overlapping. This is not a fair value gap. Okay, it's pretty simple. Like we literally just see the gaps on the chart and it's like that fair value gap. But is this a fair value gap right here? No, these WICs, they overlap. First WIC, third WIC overlaps. This is this a fair value gap right here? No. First WIC, third WIC overlaps. Is this a fair value gap right here? Yes. First WIC, third WIC, doesn't overlap. It's a fair value gap. But as we can see, without context, these things kind of fucking suck. Again, getting dick down. Okay, we might have to move off from this, but last analogy. Getting dick down without any personality or human interaction, you're pretty much just like, you're begging for an STD. You're begging for a stop loss. Okay. And that's pretty much what you're going to get if you're not seeking an understanding that there's more to an imbalance. All right. So now that we identified how to identify a fair value gap, it's pretty simple. We talked about how we can identify these. Let's talk about when we can use these and when they are best used. So if you guys have seen that my previous videos on liquidity, you guys are going to need to know what a liquidity sweep is. So if you guys haven't seen those videos, I highly recommend after this video, because I want to cover, make sure you guys aren't just jumping from idea to idea to go watch that so you guys can have this in your back pocket. So the first thing that we need to be able to identify and help us to be able to use fair value gaps is understanding where the liquidity sweep is and where price is going. Okay. I haven't really made a full video on how to understand daily bias. I should and I will eventually, there's a lot of trading videos that I need to make going into 2025. But essentially, if we can see a liquidity sweep and then a break of structure, the main thing that we want to identify is order flow. So super easy. If we can just see that we are in an uptrend, awesome. We know that this is bullish order flow. If we can see that we're in a downtrend, awesome, then we can see that that is bearish order flow. And more often than not, the earlier we are into bullish or bearish order flow, the higher confluence in the more the more trust I have in fair value gap. So if we see a liquidity sweep and then boom, we start forming bullish order flow and like we're within the second like retracement, that's super solid. Like, okay, cool. I'll be looking for a fair value gap for price to fill and then boom, we can take trades off of that. However, if we're like all the way up here and it's like, I bro, we've made one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, freaking retracements at this point, we probably shouldn't be looking to enter into lawns there. One, because price is already overextended, but also we've probably already seeked out all of the other draws on the liquidity that price was looking to take out within that bullish order flow in the first place. Same thing with bearish order flow. Boom. If we sweep out liquidity, the first, the first retracement is always going to be ideal if we can find a fair value gap within there, especially if we break structure or get an inverse for value gap, which I'm going to talk to you guys about a little bit later in this video. If we can get a liquidity sweep, break with structure, then get a fair value gap to get filled. Oh, like boom, we're going absolutely berserk, okay? And then we're looking to enter off of that. And then second retracement, awesome. Still cranking, cranking my shit. Okay. Third retracement. Okay. Maybe a slow stroke. Maybe a slow stroke. If we haven't taken out our full take profit yet, maybe, you know, maybe we get a little bust, but you know, we're not trying to go too crazy. If we've already taken out our full take profit, there's no reason to even jork our shit. Okay. Because full take profit has been hit. Our bias has been completed for the day. Okay. Cool. So now let's show this. I know that sounded crazy, but let's show this as an example within market open. And as you guys know, most like my strategy is pretty, pretty simple. And if you guys want to learn how I actually put everything together, and if you guys want to get coached by me, I have a full mentorship where I go over literally every single confluence that I have ever talked about and shit that I haven't talked about on YouTube, talking about order flow, talking about liquidity sweep, talking about daily bias, talking about fair value gap, talking about inverse for value gap, talking about breaker block, equilibrium order blocks, all of that stuff. And there's a link in the description for you guys to sign up to that. If you guys want to learn more from me, be mentored by me for literally like get on coach and calls with me. And for me to be able to actually walk you step by step through this stuff. Unfortunately, on YouTube videos, I can just get a brief little understanding of what you guys may need. But within the mentorship, it's like you guys can literally tell me like, help, I don't understand this. And then I can come in and I can fix it straight away. So if you guys want to sign up to that or have the potential, because this is an application process. Okay, not everybody's going to be allowed to get in, because we only want to take real people that are actually trying to do this. There's going to be like in the description. So let's go ahead and talk about how we can actually start applying this. So let's go into yesterday's price action wasn't the best. Let's look for, let's look at Thursday's price action. See if Thursday had a good fair value gap set up. So oh yes, no, Thursday did have a perfect three-way gap set up. So I'm not going to walk through like the full strategy. The main thing that we want to look for is fair value gaps here. And then after this, I'm going to be talking about inverse fair value gaps. So to keep it short, we're going to speed run through the majority of my strategy. Okay, market opens, liquidity sweep, following that break of structure right here. What do we see following the break of structure? Okay, so we know if we get a liquidity sweep to the upside, we're going to be looking for shorts to the downside. And we get a break of structure. So what like we got two of our steps in, we see a liquidity sweep and then a break of bullish order flow into bearish order flow. So that's that should be ringing in our heads like, holy shit, we should get ready to look for a dick. Ooh, holy shit, we should get ready to look for a dick. Ready, we're looking for Drake's shit on the chart. Okay, because if we see a liquidity sweep, break of structure, we're looking for dicks. Okay, and what do we have? Boom, Drake is all over the chart. We have one bearish for value gap here. We have another bearish for value gap here. Okay, again, we take it from the first wicks, bottom candle down to the third wicks, top candle, or sorry, the first, the first candle's bottom wick to the third candle's top wick when it's a bearish for value gap. Okay, then we have another one right here. What do we see price do? It comes in, it fills that imbalance, and then we see selling pressure out of it, and then what do we see price do? Boom, royal fucking rumble to the downside. And then price ends up going to seek out whatever, a bunch of different draws on liquidity, like right here. Come on, right, whatever. My magnet's tweaking. But price ends up going all the way down to hit like literally a 1-2.8 restore ward ratio. Okay, perfect example. We also have a pad, a perfect example of that on Thursday, on ES. So let's talk about that one as well. And then we'll find a bullish example for fair value gaps as well. So again, similar situation, market opens, liquidity sweep, break of structure, what are we doing? We're looking for Drake. Okay, we have this small one. Again, the little ones matter too. We have this small bearish for value gap right here. Then we have this bearish for value gap right here. What do we see? Price comes in, fills the bearish for value gap. Boom, we get a little sell off. Okay, short work. And then what does price do? It goes, seeks out draws on liquidity down here. Okay, and again, this is just talking about fair value gaps. There's a lot of other videos where I talk about how to set take profits, how to set stop losses. And I also talk about that in the mentorship and obviously help you guys learn how to put all of these pieces together. But today we're just talking about fair value gaps. But we can see liquidity sweep, break of structure. This is the first retracement. After we start forming bearish order flow on that break of structure, this is a retrace confluence. Okay, what I like to call fair value gaps are continuation confluence. Why? Because when we're within an uptrend, what are we looking for the trend to do? It's looking to continue. And how do we continue that trend? Typically, by filling in fair value gaps, these are continuation confluences. When price retraces more often than not, it's going to fill a fair value gap. So these are continuation confluences. Okay, now let's find a bullish example. Let's see if we can go back and let's look at Wednesday's price action. I think Wednesday was pretty bad price action. Oh, I think NASDAQ had a good bullish setup on Tuesday. If I remember correctly, NASDAQ, NASDAQ, smoking on that gaspeck. Oh, wait, no, it wasn't a fair value gap. It was an order block. Okay, let's look at Monday. Let's see if Monday had a good bullish example. I want you guys to be able to get to this level. Like, you see how I'm literally able to just scroll to the days that the shit happens on. And I'm able to instantly identify whether we have an example of that or not. Like, I want you guys to be at soon to be at that level. This has got to be one. Hell yeah, there is one. Movie. Okay, bullish example right here. Just look at this shit. Look at it. It's literally perfect. Okay, hopefully you guys already see this. If you guys don't, it's okay. Daddy's going to hold your hand. Okay, what do we see? La cuirre de suipe. Okay, liquidity sweep. Break of structure. Then what are we looking for? Continuation confluence. Where's our fair value gap? Oh my god. For value gap, boom. Gets filled. Ball run bitches to the upside. Okay, I literally took this trade on Wednesday. liquidity sweep. Break of structure. Retrace into the fair value gap. Boom. Ripsdick to the upside. They're easily going to be able to catch trades off of this. I would go to Nasdaq. I know it was the same exact setup. Let's try and find one more bullish setup. Let's see. Tuesday. No, Tuesday did not have anything. Let's go to Monday. Monday looks like there was high impact. Yeah, if we don't have anything on here, then I'll just go straight into inverse fair value gap. Okay, yeah. Now with it. Okay, cool. But anyways, you guys get how we're supposed to use these. Okay, we're looking for three candlestick pattern. We're mainly going to be looking for liquidity sweep. Break of structure. Following that fair value gap. Pull out the sniper. Take the fucking shot. Ball run bitches. Or bear cycle bitches. Okay, now let's talk about inverse fair value gap. Inverse fair value gaps are different than fair value gaps because we're actually not really looking for these get filled. And they give us like a different perspective on where price is going to go and what price is going to do. So what I like to say is fair value gaps are continuation confluences. Inverse fair value gaps are confirmation confluences and are equal to break of structure. Okay, so inverse fair value gaps in my eyes are equal to break of structure. Now why is that? So the first thing that we need to do to understand inverse for value gaps is understand fair value gaps. Luckily, we just talked about fair value gaps. We fully understand these now. What do we know about fair value gaps? Well, like I was saying, they are continuation confluences. So when fair value gaps get filled and then price moves up because of them, like that shows bullish order flow being maintained and then the same thing to the downside. It shows bearish order flow being maintained. But what happens if we disrespect a fair value gap? Okay, what happens if we inverse a fair value gap? So let's say we have a move up right here, move down. We fill this fair value gap and then we move up. We come down, we fill this fair value gap. Then we move up and then we have another fair value gap right here. But then uh oh, price closes underneath that fair value gap. Pretty much disrespecting this fair value gap right here. Well, because we know fair value gaps are used to identify continuations and up trends and continuations in down trends. If we see this price range that is supposed to be respected while within an up trend get disrespected, what can we start crafting in our heads? What can we start thinking about? Okay, this up trend might be over and more often than not, it ends up being over and that's what actually ends up making a inverse fair value gap. So let's say we have a fair value gap right here and we are within an up trend. And then price comes down and closes underneath this bullish fair value gap. To me, that is showing that we are disrespecting the bullish order flow because the bullish order flow wanted to be maintained. It would have just filled this and continued higher. But price didn't do that. So it's disrespecting bullish order flow. So then once we see the inverse fair value gap, then what can we look in the other direction? Just like how we look for liquidity-sweep break-of-structure fair value gap. Now we can also look for liquidity-sweep and or break-of-structure or inverse fair value gap. So inverse fair value gaps are essentially equal the break-of-structure and me personally, I just use whichever comes first. So within this, we have this bullish or value gap that gets closed underneath. So now I say, okay, we just broke structure to the downside. Even if we don't close underneath the low, if we inverse a fair value gap that's supposed to be respected to the upside, I'm going to be looking for bearish fair value gaps now to potentially get filled to continue the trend down because we just disrespected bullish order flow. That's why order flow is so important. And I'll make a video on this later in the future. But that explains inverse fair value gaps. And I think the best way to show you guys this is just to show it to you guys on the chart. Okay, and there was a perfect example that we went over on Thursday. So let's go back to Thursday. The setup is the exact same. So we have a liquidity sweep. And this is the power of fair value gaps because they can go in either direction. We have this bullish fair value gap right here. Yeah, price comes in, but we don't see any buy pressure out of it. And then what happens? This can't also closes underneath it. So that ends up inversing this fair value gap. So that tells us bullish order flow is now no longer being maintained. So even if we didn't break structure here, which we did, even if we didn't break structure here, if we just saw this fair value gap get disrespected, I would be willing to start looking for a bearish fair value gap to get filled because I know that this fair value gap should have gotten filled and should have moved price higher. What do we see? Inverse fair value gap. This new bearish fair value gap gets filled and then price ends up going lower. Something that a lot of people like doing is they like saying, hey, inverse fair value gaps need to be filled. Fuck no, they don't. Inverse fair value gaps do not need to be filled. At all, inverse fair value gaps are one thing. They are not fair value gaps once they have been inverse and once they have been disrespected. How do we know if fair value gap has been disrespected when we have a gap, whether it's bullish or bearish and we close either above or below it. So if this is a bullish fair value gap and we see a candle that closes underneath the bullish fair value gap, that has then turned into an inverse fair value gap and that bullish fair value gap has been disrespected. Same thing to the downside. If we see a bearish fair value gap right here and we see a candle close above it, that bearish fair value gap has now been invalidated and now that is an inverse fair value gap that is telling us that, hey, price will likely move higher from here. Now this is a little tip that a lot of people get confused when they're talking and learning about fair value gaps and something that I feel like I should share with you guys. Let me go to a different example here. A lot of people ask, hey, TJR, when we have a bunch of fair value gaps stacked on top of each other, what do we do? Well, first of all, we want to be able to identify all of them. So we have this fair value gap right here, one and then we have another one right here and then let's say we even form another one down here. What happens if we inverse this fair value gap but we have another one above it? Will this say, will we be looking for boom reversal from that node within a stack of fair value gaps in order for me to classify it as an inverse fair value gap. So we have one gap here, another gap here, all stacked up right? And I need to show you guys an example of this where it doesn't apply but essentially, we have one gap here and then the very next, the very next three candle pattern, another gap here. For me to be able to say, okay, price has inverse these gaps and I'm looking to classify this as a break of structure and I'm looking for price to move to the upside. We have to understand if we close above this, price still can be maintaining bullish order flow because it could just fill this and then move lower. It could just be looking to fill this fair value gap and then move lower, right? So when I'm looking to look for an inverse fair value gap, if there's multiple stacked on top of each other like this, I need the top one or in the bullish scenario, I need the bottom one to be inverse. So let me find a bullish scenario of this example. Same thing here. So like look, we have this bearish fair value gap just because we closed above it right here, doesn't matter because we have all of these fair value gaps just stacked on top of each other, on top of each other, on top of each other. And the only time that we end up getting a real true inverse fair value gap is when this very top one gets inverse of this candlestick right here. So yes, this one gets inverse. Yes, this one gets inverse, but since all of these are stacked up on top of each other, without a retrace in between, that's a huge emphasis on that. Without a retrace in between, we have to wait for this one. Okay, we have to wait for this one to get inverse. And at that point, we might as well just look for a break of structure, and we ended up breaking structure right here. Okay, so let me find an example of the bullish scenario of this. Let's look for a bunch of bullish fair value gaps. Okay, so this is a good example. We have this bullish fair value gap right here. We see that price closed underneath it, but what was it trying to do? Do we instantly want to look for shorts off of that? No, because we have another bullish fair value gap right here that price was actually looking to fill before wanting to move higher. So that's why we always need to be looking at the last fair value gap within the stack. And actually this one would be the last fair value gap within the stack, okay? Let me give you guys another example and another tip that is super important for fair value gaps. I know this video is long, but it's super helpful. Next thing that we need to know about fair value gaps, okay? We need to know about balance price action and where price has been balanced and understanding what fair value gaps are going to get filled versus which ones are not going to get filled and which ones we can disregard. This is super important, so stick with me. Whenever we are in an uptrend or a downtrend, once we get a retrace, and then let me just draw this out. So if we're in an uptrend, right? And we see price retraced into a fair value gap, fill it and then move past this high. We have balanced all price action from this low and under now. All price action from this low and underneath is fully balanced out. So we do not care about a order block down here. We do not care about a fair value gap down here. We do not care about a breaker block down here because price has already pushed past this high and continued the uptrend. Following that, when price comes down, if we have a fair value gap right here and it gets filled and then we push past this high, even if we have a fair value gap right here that did not get filled because we pushed past this high and we continued the uptrend. All price underneath this low has been balanced out. So we no longer care about this fair value gap. We no longer care about the other fair value gaps that are down here. We don't care about anything from price underneath this within this uptrend because we push past this high and we've continued the uptrend. So if we push up and then we have a fair value gap here and then a fair value gap here, let's say we push down past this fair value gap and then end up filling this fair value gap and then pushing up past this high. Now, even if we have a fair value gap here, we don't care about it. We only care about price from here and above now, once we push past this high, same thing in a downtrend and I'm going to show you guys this on the chart and you guys will understand it a little bit better. Down trend. So let's say, boom, we break structure, we fill a fair value gap right here. Let's say we have another fair value gap up here, but it doesn't matter this fair value gap gets filled. We no longer care about this fair value gap and it didn't get filled, why? Because we took out this low and we're continuing the downtrend. Okay, so we fill this fair value gap, we push past this low, we no longer care about anything, any confluences above this high. Price comes down, let's say there's a little fair value gap right here and there's like three more fair value gaps all up here. We fill this fair value gap and then we push past this low. We no longer care about any of these fair value gaps up here, why? Because we push past this low and we continue the downtrend. Okay, let me show you guys this on the chart now so you guys can get a better picture and better idea of this. Let me go to that, what was it? It was Wednesday, this one, yeah. Okay, cool, so, I mean this, whatever, but we can understand the point of this. So again, we see the liquidity sweep, we see the break structure, we have this fair value gap, it gets filled and then after this fair value gap gets filled, I know we can't see the high, but I'm like the one minute we push past this high here. Once this fair value gap gets filled, we no longer care. We have this order block right here, even though it got filled, we don't care about it anymore. We have this breaker block that got filled, we don't care about it anymore. Everything from this low and underneath, we no longer care about those confluences. Now, this is like mainly applicable for like a bunch of fair value gap stacked on top of each other. So I just want to find a good example of that. So I can show this well. Let me use this stack of fair value gaps for an example. So we have this fair value gap right here and then this fair value gap right here. So we have two fair value gaps stacked up on top of each other. Let's say price opens on Sunday and we come up, we fill this imbalance and then we come down and we could take out this low. Now, even though there is this gap up here, we no longer care about it. Why? Because we have continued the downtrend. We have filled an imbalance and we have pushed past this low. So now the only confluences that we're looking for, if we see price retracing, we should never be thinking, okay, we're going to come up and fill this fair value gap. No, fuck no. We're going to be looking for confluences within this leg down. Why? Because this leg down is the one that took out this low and now we're looking because think about it. Think about how trends work. They move up, they fill a confluence and then they move down and once they take out a low, they're going to move up again. And they never push past these highs or else that will be a break of structure and then the trend will change, right? So we're now only going to be looking for confluences within here, whether there's like multiple fair value gaps within here. Cool, we see a fair value gap, it gets filled, then we push underneath this low. Now we don't care about if there's a fair value gap in here, there's an order block breaker block. We don't care about it because we filled this fair value gap and then we took out this low and we continued the downtrend. Now the reason why I brought this up is not only for fair value gaps but also for inverse fair value gaps. So if we come through, we fill this fair value gap, this barrage for value gap and then we come down and we take out this low. Now we have this barrage for value gap right here or let's just say we form a barrage for value gap right here, a barrage for value gap right here. If we're looking for a barrage for value gap and we haven't made a retracement yet, which fair value gap are we going to have to wait for in order for us to inverse this downtrend or get an inverse fair value gap? Are we going to have to wait for this one? No. Now I know what you're probably saying. I thought you said if it stacked up, yes, if it stacked up within the same leg down. So when we get a retrace, it pretty much resets the fair value gap cycle. So we come up, we fill this fair value gap, then we get to move down. Now we have two fair value gaps. So in order for me to see an inverse fair value gap or for me to inverse and look for a trend reversal, I'm going on need to see this fair value gap to get inverse. Why? Because we haven't made a retracement yet, okay? But I don't need to wait for this one. I just need to wait for the top one within this leg down. Now let's say we come up, we fill in this imbalance and then boom, we push past this leg and then we form another imbalance right here and there's only one. Which fair value gap am I going to have to wait for for me to see an inverse fair value gap for me to want to look for longs or for me to want to look for now a bullish fair value gap to take longs to the upside? Am I going to have to wait for this one because it stacked up? No, why? Because we already filled a fair value gap and then moved past a new low. So now we already have a new leg down that we're considering. So if we inverse this, I'm not going to have to wait for this fair value gap to get inverse. I'm not going to have to wait for this fair value gap to get inverse. Why? Because price from this move up and then down everything above this high has already been balanced out. Even though there's this fair value gap here, we no longer care about it. Then from here, even though we have this fair value gap here, everything from this high and above has been balanced out. So we no longer care about that. But everything from this high and below hasn't been balanced out yet. So we do care about these fair value gaps. So if we end up inversing this, then we do care about it and say, OK, order flows probably going to change to the upside. Then from there, we can look for bullish fair value gaps to get filled to then look for longs. Let me show you guys an example of this on the chart. And again, if this is confusing, I completely understand. But I'm really trying to put this shit together for you guys. We're going like, we're going really deep into this. And hopefully this is starting to make sense for you. So let's show an example of, let's show the inverse fair value gap example. OK, this is a perfect example. I actually know it's not because the fair value gap wasn't filled. OK, this is like a semi example, but there's not an inverse fair value gap. But if this makes sense to you guys. So within this five minute trend down, we're in a downtrend, right? We end up taking out this low. Then we get a retracement. Yes, we don't fill these fair value gaps. But what do we end up doing? Even though we didn't fill these fair value gaps, these fair value gaps that are stacked on top of each other, what do we end up doing? This was the new low that was formed. We get a little retrace up. And then boom, we take out this new low. So now we don't care about these fair value gaps that are above this high. Why? Because price already moved up and then took out this low continuing the downtrend. So now, even though there's no confluence within here to be able to push price down further, price from this high and above, we don't care about it. We're not looking for price to retrace into these fair value gaps then continue down. Why? Because we already retraced them. We already took out this low showing that this downtrend should continue. So when we get this break of structure to the upside on this candlestick right here, some people might be like, well, we still have this bearish fair value gap. We might be able to go lower. No, because we already broke structure to the upside. And we already established that everything above this high, we no longer care about why? Because it took out this low on the downtrend. So this inverse fair value gap, or this fair value gap, we don't care about this fair value gap. We don't care about. We only care about the break of structure. Then literally... Oh, it's right in front of your faces. We get a break of structure. Then what? Boom! Bullish fair value gap right here. Sorry, I'm spashing. Bullish fair value gap right here. It fills boom. Price. Bull run. Fucking bitches. It goes higher. Yes. Are you seeing it now? Hopefully you are. Let me find a better example of this so we can try and put this together. I want to find a good example of like... ...in balances. Okay, this is another good example. Unfortunately, there's no inverse fair value gap. But look here. Okay, so we're within an uptrend. This is at a random ass time. Okay, so again, we don't have all of our confluence as we don't have liquidity, sweet, break, or structure, whatever. But I just want to show you guys this for context. We have a bullish fair value gap right here. We have a bullish fair value gap right here. Price comes down. We have a bullish fair value gap and then what does it do? It continues the uptrend by taking out this high. So now we no longer care about this bullish fair value gap. Why? Because we already showed and confirmed that everything from this low and below we shouldn't care about because it filled this fair value gap and then ended up continuing the trend by taking out this high. Cool. So when price ends up breaking five minute structure right here to the downside, we shouldn't be worried about this fair value gap right here needing or getting filled to then move up higher. Why? We established that this moved down and then up balanced out price action from here and everything below it. Okay. Now, obviously we don't know the overall trend. We don't know the overall bias. So this is kind of taken out of context, but that's another good example. I really want to find an example with an inverse fair value gap. Oh, this is yes. I finally found one. Okay. So again, this is at a random time. It's during London session, but this is like the one example that I was able to find. So currently right here on the five minute timeframe, we're within a downtrend, right? Obviously, we're going to want to wait for like the quidditch sweet right structure and at the right time during New York session, all of these things, but let's just use this example here. So we know that price came up and it filled this fair value gap and then moved down and took out this low and on top of that, we also have fair value gaps right here. We also have a fair value gap up here. Okay. Fair value gap and this fair value gap, they haven't been filled yet, but after we'll start it from all the way up here, we come down, then we get a retracement up and we don't even fill this fair value gap. Why can we disregard it or when can we disregard it? Once we take out this low and continue the downtrend. Once we take out this low, we can say everything from this high and above, we don't care about those influences anymore. Why? Because we continue the downtrend underneath this low. So now we know we can literally remove this fair value gap. We should never think about it again. Literally never think about it again because it's only applicable within this downtrend. In this downtrend, we showed that hey, we balance out price action and now we're continuing it. So we shouldn't care about this. It should no longer be marked out. We can fully forget it. Then following that on this leg down, we have boom, fair value gap here, fair value gap here. We see price for a low right here. We push up, we only fill this fair value gap and then what happens? We continue the downtrend by taking out this low. So what do we do? We no longer care about this fair value gap and we no longer care about any influences from this high and higher. So we don't care about this fair value gap. We don't care about this fair value gap. We don't care about any of those. Now what fair value gaps are we considering? We're not even considering this one anymore because it's been filled. Price action has been balanced because we took out this low. Now we are going to see the power of an inverse fair value gap that happens before a break of structure. Finally, I was able to find an example. Because we took out this low, we have this bearish imbalance. We are expecting price to fill this bearish imbalance and then move lower. And we know that if price pushes past this bearish imbalance and disrespects it, there's no other influences that we're looking to consider up here. Why? Because prior to that, prices already balanced out those legs. Why? Because it took out those lows. So we don't care about this fair value gap because even if price is moving up, it's not going to do anything off of that. It's going to be off of a different confluence on a different time break. We don't care about that anymore. So once we see this candle, disrespect this fair value gap, awesome. That's when we could say boom, the trend has changed. We're going to end up moving higher. Now obviously and unfortunately in this example, this is at a random ass time during like going into London session, coming into New York session. So prices are going to be moving weird. But using this at the right time and in the right place is just, it works like a freaking charm. Let's see here. I think this might actually be a good example too. Okay, this is perfect. This is another example. Within this leg up, what are we in? We're in an uptrend. And since we know we retrace down and then we took out this high, we can disregard every single confluence that's under this low. Right? Luckily there's not really any confluence is underneath this low. But we're only considering the fair value gaps within this extension up now or the confluence is within this extension up. So what do we have? We have a fair value gap right here. And then we also have a fair value gap right here. The tiniest one. But again, sizes and matter. On this down candle right here, we end up breaking structure two, but just for example, purposes, this down candle right here, what do we get? We inverse both these fair value gaps. So boom, we know that we should be looking for shorts now. Then following that, what does price do? It comes up and it fills in this bearish for a value gap and then ends up continuing lower. Boom, price ends up rumbling on down, taking out this strong liquidity. So to recap, fair value gaps are imbalance price action that are used as continuation confluence is within up trends and downtrends. Inverse fair value gaps are used as confirmation confluence is that we are confirming that price is disrespecting current order flow and will more than likely reverse the current trend that we are in. And again, there's a reason why it's fair value gaps and inverse fair value gaps are showing us that hey, we are continuing. We're continuing the trend inverse fair value gaps are showing us that hey, we are going against the trend. Okay, and we're probably going to reverse. Hopefully you guys learned a lot from this video. Hopefully you guys can take this and apply this within your own trading. I know this was a long video, but amen, I had to get all this shit off my chest. Hopefully you guys learned more about order flow. Hopefully you guys learn more about fair value gaps and inverse fair value gaps when to use them, when to not use them. Which ones you guys can learn to identify and which ones not to. I appreciate you guys. I'll catch you guys in the next one. Peace out.

=== VIDEO 7/34 : How I Made $427,390 In One Day Trading FOMC!-egQLtQLmauk.txt
============================================

Hey guys, this is how I made $427,000 day trading FOMC today. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to record this on my computer while it was happening. I did get a screen recording of me entering and exiting. And on top of that, I showed my PNL from the day, the week, and the month per usual. My Instagram story for this trade, I'm going to try and send the screen recording to my editor, so he can go ahead and put those clips together of me entering and me exiting on screen recording. I was literally on a Zoom call while this was happening. So I was using my PC for the Zoom and I was trading on my phone while this dude was yapping to me about transfer price study for my other businesses. So, um, but anyways, I wanted to get into the thought process on this. I know this seems a little bit ridiculous and you're probably saying, why on earth were you trading news? Um, I'll tell you exactly why I've been talking about this for the past couple days now. We had a big news event that was coming out today at FOMC. We were expecting rate cuts for pretty much this entire, the past week and a half really. We see that last week was very bullish. The first half of this week was very bullish and I being the logical person that I'm in, I see how bullish we are and I know that FOMC is coming up and I know that pretty much everyone and their mother was predicting that we were going to get a rate cut of 25 bips. Okay, so with that in mind, everyone's buying the market up. There's leverage longs going down. People are going long on US equities and on crypto and of things of that nature. Cool. The market has already priced in that, uh, the interest rate cuts. Okay? So, when we have a rumor like this, it is more often than not by the rumor and you sell the news. Not literally, well, I mean, for me, literally, I sold the news, but, um, it's what happens on the chart. So, we look at when the rumors started, uh, rate cuts right around down here. Boom. Oh my gosh, we're going to get rate cuts. Bullish, bullish, bullish, bullish, bullish. Interest rates are going to go down. It's bullish for the markets. Awesome. Cool. Everybody's buying it up and then when the news, news event actually comes out, what happens, price ends up dumping. Man, it was super short term, but I was able to capitalize on this. Why? By using the same technical analysis that I use on a daily basis, just a little bit more aggressive. Um, so we can see here that on the high time frame, I marked out, um, multiple sets of high-time frame highs. But it was essentially because I knew that this was going to be a very drastic news event, I marked out the top of all of these low resistance highs. So we have low resistance and high, like, uh, low resistance, high right here, low resistance, high right here. On NASDAQ, I marked out the top of all of these low resistance highs. We've low resistance, high right here, low resistance, high right here and low resistance, high right here. Once I saw that the S&P 500 immediately came up and took out these low resistance highs, and then the second that I saw this massive wick right here, I was like, okay, this is a great sign. We took out high time frame highs because again, when news data like this, when super impactful and or just big news data, and this was like one of the most anticipated news data drops of like at least this year, not saying that it's going to be that drastic of a move, but there was ridiculous amounts of people making bets on it in prediction markets. Understanding these things helped me make this decision, where one, there was a lot of people who were wanting to go along, who were super bullish on this news event, okay, similar to when whatever Elon Musk was going on SNL on when Doge was like super close to dollar, they were like, holy shit, we got to pump it up because once he gets on SNL, he's going to talk about Dogecoin and then what happened, he didn't talk about Dogecoin by the rumor, sell the news. It's the same shit with this, okay, so the S&P 500 comes up and we sweep out these highs, okay, I was expecting there to be a bearish SMT from those highs because again, this is a super drastic news event, more often than not, news is going to boom, sweep out a bunch of high time frame liquidity in either direction, okay, it could very well could have shot down and then shot up, but again, I already made a prediction, in fact, I'll let you guys listen to this TikTok that I made literally 15 minutes before market or before this news came out. So everybody's super excited about how full I'm seeing today because we are expecting rate cuts. I personally think that rate cuts have already been priced into the market and this is a by the rumor sell the news event and no, I don't mean literally, I mean figuratively, where the rumor of rate cuts and everybody anticipating rate cuts has caused price to move up drastically over the past week and a half and now we are probably going to get rate cuts in the next 30 minutes and I think that there's going to be a very large wake up and then boom, we are going to fall down. There has been a ridiculous amount of leverage long positions that have been placed not only in the futures market but also in the crypto market that need to be liquidated so I think that this is going to be a sell the news event and I also think that this is a pretty solid time for price to kickstart a little downtrend on the higher time rates because we are due for one. So yeah, that's just my two cents. That's what I think going into FOMC, we will see what happens. Not only did I do that, I also made a tweet 15 minutes before FOMC that said, market has already priced in the 25 Bips rate cuts. It will cause the market to dump if we cut rates by 50 Bips, we will moonshot, we shall see what happens. Anyways, I was going off of what I had been saying throughout this entire week. This was as expected. This in my eyes was a solid trade. I risked a good amount on this and in turn I was able to make a very good amount on this back. Take profits were very simple. I went ahead and set take profit one underneath these hourly lows and then I went ahead and set take profit two underneath these relative equal lows right here, these low resistance lows right here. I also got out as you guys can see at damn near the perfect time price went a little bit further down than I expected it to but I mean shit for all time back news. On the S&P 500, we didn't get anywhere close to these lows that I had marked out on NASDAQ in turn. We're kind of making a bit of a bullish S&T right now but that's besides the point. That's how I traded today. I'll go ahead and I'll try and stitch together the screen recording videos so you guys can go ahead and watch me execute in real time. So that being said appreciate y'all. I am I mean fuck you bro. I had a wiggle room now for this week to trade more. Thursday will probably trade well. Friday will probably trade well. I'm obviously going to reduce risk so I don't give back a whole bunch of this money to the market overall looking great on the month overall looking great on the week and today was a great day to be me. So I'll go ahead and I'll stitch all these videos together and you guys can go ahead and see the entries and exits right now.

=== VIDEO 8/34 : How I Reprogrammed My Mind to Make $5,000 Everyday-8FO-Dal-L7U.txt
============================================

I used to be the trader that would literally blow accounts like it was their full-time job I would be over leveraging over trading and overthinking and obviously that helped me stay Unprofitable, but I was able to transform myself and change the way that I think reprogram the way that I think to now Own a house in cash own multiple cars have a separate place out of Miami And it all was due to a mindset shift not by anything different on the charts because my strategy was good The confluence is that I was trading with were really good as well And it's literally the same exact strategy that I'm using to this day that I was using back when I was unprofitable The only thing that I had to change was the way that I thought so today in this video I want to teach you guys how to reverse and reprogram your guys' psychology so that you guys can hopefully break out of that Unprofitability spell to eventually turn into a profitable day trader. So with that being said, let's get into it So when I first got into trading just like everybody else I was just like boom this is going to make me rich in one week or in two weeks And in fact, I was like I need this to make me rich in the next one week or two weekend If you are in that position right now and you're like, yeah, this is gonna be it I'm gonna learn the reprogramming and then boom it's gonna happen bro Just literally click off the video trading is not going to be for you my guy You might want us fill out a McDonald's application, okay? All in all just like any other unprofitable trader We get into this because we want to get rich quick That's how that's why the majority of us get into online money making businesses in the first place or into these side houses Because we're like look at all these people online that are making a shit ton of money look at TJR He's making so much money day trading. I'm gonna be just like him tomorrow or look at this person He's making so much money drop shipping. I can't wait to be like him next month And that's just not the case with any form of success It's going to take some time to be able to get there and by putting yourself in this headspace You are automatically fucking up. You are literally putting yourself at a disadvantage because you're putting a set time If this doesn't work out in a week then I'm said and done and I'll move on to the next thing or this thing won't work And it will cause you to not get the results that you want But it also doesn't give you enough time to get the results that you want and it also causes you to act in a certain way To not get the results that you want your headspace is what causes you to act the way that you guys do Your subconscious is what causes you to act the way that you do so in order for us to get the results that we want We need to reprogram our subconscious to be able to take actions in the way that we want to be able to reach our goals And with that headspace of saying I need to get rich today I need to get rich in a week. I need to get rich in a month without expanding our time horizons It will never lead to the results that we need or that we want once you guys fall into this trap You guys will probably start realizing that you guys are making the same mistakes over and over and over again Man, I keep over trading man. I keep over leveraging. Oh man I was a little bit too greedy within the market. You start noticing these mistakes occur over and over and over again But the worst part about it is that we keep repeating these mistakes over and over and over again And we need to do something about it. Why do we know the mistakes that we're making? We know the mistakes that are holding us back from getting to our end goals Why do we keep repeating them? It's because our subconscious is programmed and thinking in a certain way to cause us to act in that manner And trust me the reason why I know this and a lot of you guys are like man That sounds just like me. I keep making the same mistakes over and over and over again I can't stick to my strategy. I can't stick to my risk management plan And that's what's causing me to fuck up. I was there before that was literally me when I was an unprofitable trader I was like hey if I just stuck to my strategy if I just use good risk management Then I would probably be a profitable trader But for whatever reason I couldn't help myself to stop over trading to stop over leveraging to stop over thinking There was something that I had to change and again the real breakthrough didn't happen by me changing something in my strategy Because I already had a good strategy the real breakthrough didn't come through if me Re-adjusting my risk management plan I wasn't even fucking following my risk management plan and you aren't either the biggest adjustment for me was Re-managing and rearranging how I thought about trading and the first biggest thing that helped me get to where I wanted to go With trading was just expanding my time horizon the majority of day traders that you guys see on YouTube or on Tiktok or on social media that are finding success you see how long it took for them to acquire this high leverage skill that can change your life forever And they tell you hey, this took me a year This took me two years to be able to finally turn profitable and that's when I started seeing results What makes you think that you are the exception to these time horizon? What makes you think that you will be able to learn this very high value very high leverage skill that a lot of other people Really really want to do as well What makes you think that you can do that in two weeks? If you were able to do it in two weeks that everybody would be doing this That's not the case all of the best rewards lie at the end of years and months of hard work to be able to get to that point So the first big thing that I had to change in my head was understanding that this isn't going to happen a week This isn't going to happen in a month and this might not happen in a year But I know that if I put my head down and be consistent at this skill continuing trying to grow on a daily basis Correct my mistakes then over time I am bound to succeed and I don't care about what the timeline is because I know once I achieve this skill As you guys have seen me do once I achieve this skill it will endlessly reward me for the rest of my life That is how you guys need to be thinking about this and at the end of the day one year two years worth of sacrifice to be able to change your life forever Is a tiny little blip on your massive timeline of life Imagine you guys put in a bunch of hard work for a year or two years straight and then that drastically alters literally the trajectory of your life forever Me personally I'm risking and I'm putting my all into that year into those two years and I don't give a fuck what happens I don't give a fuck how hard it is because I know the end result that is going to be waiting for me at the end of all that hard work The second thing that I had to reprogram in my head was treating trading like a business How can I handle myself like a real fucking business man in trading? How can I treat myself like I'm already at those goals that I dream and aspire to be you guys always see me You guys always see all these other profitable traders getting on here talking about stick to your strategy stick to your risk management plan Yet you guys as unprofitable traders seem to fail to do that over and over again You guys are not acting and you guys are not behaving like profitable traders This is why manifestation works when we say I'm a profitable trader I am making this much per month with day trading I stick to my day trading strategy I stick to my risk management plan by putting that in our subconscious We in turn will want to act that way So we need to reverse engineer this and this is a really good role play for you guys to do sit yourself down and Imagine yourself having achieved all of your goals and all of your dreams Being a profitable trader making X amount of money per month having whatever car having whatever house put yourself in your dream life That's right here you Can see and you can understand that this is possible now. Let's think about what steps did he have or she Have to do to be able to get to this point and We just go back down the steps of the timeline They sure as hell didn't get there by over leveraging they sure as hell didn't get there by over trading They sure as hell didn't get there by overthinking so we need to reverse engineer this think about okay Who do I want to be and start acting like them because if we have this person as our goal dream person dream life And we can start acting as if we are this person at this end of your timeline Then those actions are going to lead you to where your dreams are to where your goals are And that was a big thing that I had to change in my head because I sat myself down one day and I was like man I keep fucking up and I watch a YouTube video and I'm like man I want to figure this out and then eventually it like it just fucking clicked in my head I'm like wait what if I just did what I was supposed to I know that sounds stupid But you just do what you're supposed to and stop making the same mistakes over and over again And that's a lot easier said than done and this leads me into the third step of discipline no matter what discipline is One of the most difficult skills to build because there's bad habits that Traumatize our lives every single day and there's not a single person in this entire world that doesn't not have a bad habit There's not a single person everybody in the world has a bad habit or multiple bad habits It's up to us to try and break down those bad habits that are limiting us To be able to complete those steps to get to our dream goal to become our dream person to have our dream life We know the steps that we have to take in order to get there We know the timeline that it's going to take in order to get there Matter of fact, we don't give a fuck about the timeline that it's going to take in order to get there Because we know that if we follow those steps with discipline with consistency Eventually if we are acting like this person over here as an unprofitable trader If we act as a profitable trader as an unprofitable trader What do you think eventually is going to happen as time goes on as weeks and months and potentially a year goes on You're going to get closer and closer and closer and closer to that profitable trader goal dream life that you guys want I know it sounds crazy But when you sit yourself down every day knowing damn well that you are unprofitable Knowing that you're not successful in the markets Imagine what that does for your trading Imagine what that does for you. So what I used to do when I was unprofitable I would take a cold shower again You guys don't need need to do this, but this is what worked for me I would take a cold shower and while the water is rushing over my head I would say to myself over and over and over again. I am a profitable trader I stick to my trading plan. I stick to my risk management plan And I would say a bunch of other bullshit too that you guys can by all means do it I would say I own a Lambo. I'm investing in crypto Just things that I wanted to happen in my life so I could reprogram my subconscious So that when I did sit down at the charts I had all these things just ringing in my head over and over and over again I am a profitable trader. I stick to my day trading strategy I stick to my risk management plan. I own a Lambo whatever. I'm investing in crypto All of these things are just going through my head over and over and over again Matter of fact, I completely forgot that I have this right next This is my old notebook. Look I'll literally bring up What I would say bro here we go Read daily read daily. I will be a millionaire. I will own a Lamborghini I will take good trades. I will see good setups. I will be patient. I will be patient I will be patient. I had to write that down three times because patience was one of my issues I was saying I would only look at the four-hour one-hour daily timeframes to enter blah blah blah But you guys get the point I would write these things down and on top of that I would say these things so that it was so drilled in my head that by the time I sat myself down to be able to trade I wasn't saying I'm unprofitable Like because that just is going to be ringing in your head And I'm sure it's ringing in your guys's head where you're just like man I can't pass a fund into account I can't make money in the markets And then you get on to the markets and then guess what you're going to act that way You're going to act irresponsibly You're going to act like an unprofitable trader And then where is that going to lead you on your timeline to forever be stuck to forever be an unprofitable trader Because you're thinking in a unprofitable traders mindset versus if you can reprogram your mind and think I am a profitable trader I am successful in trading. I follow my trading plan I follow my risk management plan And then you wake up every single day say those things over and over and over and over again And then you be consistent with those actions with those steps with that headspace You are eventually going to take steps that lead you to this goal And believe it or not you're eventually going to become this human that you like literally dreamed about You're literally going to blink one day after time has passed Of you just doing this over and over and over again And you're going to wake up in your dream life I'm telling you guys this because the same shit happened to me Where all of this just like flew by bro I remember exactly when I was unprofitable And I remember how hard it was for me to be able to try and master these charts But I think back to that and it feels like fucking yesterday that that happened And I feel like I blinked my eyes and now I open them and I'm living this dream life that I've always wanted for myself And the same thing can happen for you Obviously all of this sounds great and for some of you guys you guys are probably like oh yeah There's no way this actually like is going to apply to trading Trading it like consists of a whole bunch of stuff and success consists of a whole bunch of stuff And strategy understanding how the market moves Is just one small Miniscule piece of the puzzle of you becoming a profitable trader If I were to talk to my unprofitable self right now which is you guys That's why I make these videos in the first place And if I were to be able to tell him one thing You already know enough about strategy You already know enough about confluences You already know enough about the charts and why they move in the way that they do You need to step away from that And step into your own brain and figure out why you are undisciplined Why you keep making the same mistakes over and over again Because at the end of the day it's not your strategy that is causing you to lose money It's your bad habits that are causing you to lose money Causing you to blow funded accounts and stopping you from reaching your dream goal And that's exactly what I try and teach literally all of my students That's why I'm making this YouTube video for you guys The people that are within my blueprint program they not only learn strategy But I alternate between trade recap calls, market recap calls But also psychological calls to help get these people and unprofitable traders Over these roadblocks on their timeline to be able to get them to where they want to go Because I know how important it was within my journey Where I knew so much about the charts You guys already know so much about the charts If you guys have gone through my free course, I'll leave the link in the description If you guys have gone through the boot camp on YouTube If you guys have gone through that five and a half hour long video You guys know a lot about why price moves the way that it does on the charts You guys probably don't need to be drilling that more and more What you guys do need to be drilling is your head, your mental, your psychology That is what's holding you guys back A lot of unprofitable traders they get into the market And they just think strategy strategy strategy strategy That's going to be the key to my success And yes, it's a part of the key to success within trading But it's not everything And when you make it everything, you are holding yourself back Because there's so many other things like discipline, psychology, consistency That are required to get you guys to this dream goal And that's why with my blueprint students I alternate between market recap because most of these guys They know my strategy like the back of their fucking hand Okay, we're in there going over their trades And I'm like, yep, you took the same trade as me Yep, you took the same trade as me Yep, you took the same trade as me But some of them, even though they're taking the same trades as me Even though they're using the same strategy as me Because I give them full in-depth strategy And like breakdown using my confluences Teach them how to do that on their own They're still unprofitable Why? Because they're undisciplined Because they're not consistent Because they're overleveraging Because maybe they took the same trade as me As their first trade of the day But then they got greedy And then they took two more And those two more trades set them back And caused them to blow a funded account Caused them to blow their live account Caused them to overrisk Caused them to overleverage And that's why I reinforce psychology so much within my program Which again, if you guys want to be one of my students You guys can click the link down in the description I could care less if you guys want to be my student Or not Because this video is going to help you guys a lot regardless But we need to be drilling not only strategy But also psychology Strategies one of the easiest things You learn it You drill it during live market But people just completely neglect Psychology and how they should be thinking about trading And I'm telling you guys on a weekly basis I get on Zoom calls with my students And I break down how they should be thinking about the markets Different ways, different drills Different homework For them to sit down and reprogram their brains So that they can think about trading in the right way And I want the same thing to be possible for you guys Whether it's watching this YouTube video right now So you guys can get in the right head space To be able to reprogram your brain Because I'm telling you guys right now You guys probably already know strategy Like the back of your fucking hand But you're missing out on psychology And that's why I'm making this YouTube video That's why my blueprint students Go over psychology calls with me And other coaches On a weekly basis To reinforce that And that's why you guys see so many fucking success stories On my Instagram story I'm posting testimonials every single fucking day A people that are passing funded accounts That are making money on a consistent basis And you're probably sitting there watching those Thinking why isn't that me It's because we are doing work To be able to change these people's brains On YouTube it's one thing for me to sit here And say you guys need to do it And then it's just up to y'all But for me and my students I prioritize them over everything else I make sure that they do that We do drills within calls I'm getting on a call once a week with them Giving them a speech like this Breaking down how they can think about trading in a different way So that they can get over those roadblocks That are causing them to stay far far away From this dream life that they have in mind And by doing that It's going to remove those roadblocks To help them have a clear Narrow straight path towards profitability So again, if you guys want to be one of my students You guys can click the link down in the description Those people are getting coached directly from me Getting talks like this to help them Rearrange their psychology To be able to get to where they want to go But also this YouTube video is great for you guys as well But with YouTube It's just like I'm trying to tell you guys like Hey please do it And then it's up to you guys to do it So there you have it I love and appreciate y'all Hopefully please I'm fucking begging you guys Take action And do these things that I'm saying in this video And if you guys completely neglect this video I don't know what the fuck to tell you Because trading is a lot more than just understanding Where the chart wants to go It's way more than understanding where the chart wants to go I could know damn well where the chart wants to go But if I'm overriscing over leveraging Overtrading overthinking I'm not going to find success in the markets And that's what I'll leave you guys with I love and appreciate you guys I'll catch you guys in the next one Peace out

=== VIDEO 9/34 : How To Find Daily Bias (Step By Step)-e_FV0Q14k8E.txt
============================================

If you guys are waking up every single morning staring at the charts and having no freaking clue what to do or where price is going to go Then this video is for you guys in this video I'm going to be doing a full in-depth breakdown of how I find my daily bias every single day Again a lot of people have different ways about doing this or you guys will hear a whole bunch of traders say like Oh, yeah, my daily bias is bullish for the day or my daily bias is bearish But you guys just have no clue of how we came to that conclusion So I'm going to share with you guys how I've been finding my daily bias recently that's been helping me a lot in Understanding where price wants to go because more often than not on the chart We will have a draw on the quiddity or an area that we can totally see price going to but then price ends up going in the other Direction or there's two different draws on the quiddity and you're like man I wish I knew where price was going to go for the day and in this video I'm going to cover how I find my daily bias and how you guys are able to get out of these situations and how you guys are able to actually capitalize on these situations so with that being said let's jump in the charts This isn't going to be any bullshit any freaking indicator whatever or actually no that I am going to be using one indicator But it's just to mark out session highs and lows, but with that being said let's pull up the charts right now So this is actually market just open 10 minutes ago. I'm not going to be trading today because we had war news that came out During Asian session unfortunately, so this is actually live trading conditions So we're going to be going over how I find my daily bias and I'm going to be doing it with the current market right now But I'll also go back through this entire week and go over it But what I first want to do is kind of map out of how I go about finding daily bias in the first place So the first thing that I want to know and understand is what did London session do and this is going to be Applicable for any session so I'm always looking at what the previous session did okay So I trade the indexes I trade the S&P 500 and NASDAQ some of you guys you guys may trade Euro Euro USD you guys may trade gold you might trade GBP USD Okay, and on those pairs you guys might be trading during London session you guys might be trading during Asian session The same thing applies. We're just looking at the past session that had just passed and if you guys know about how I trade I'm always looking to trade right at market open so regardless of if I'm trading in index or if I'm trading Forex or if I'm trading a commodity such as gold I'm going to want to be trading at a market open because I know that that's when there's going to be volume and volatility Coming into the market there's going to be new money Flooding into the market to be able to give us a move for us to trade on okay And that's typically when we get the most volume and the most volatility and that's typically when these moves are made So we are going to be looking at the last sessions Move and you're probably saying well like okay, how do we even understand this? So there's literally only three ways that the past session can move and a lot of people call these daily profiles or whatever I don't really you know That's just two fucking fancies just like what did the last fucking session do? Okay, let's just keep it at that. What did the last session do? So for me when I'm trading New York session what session comes before New York London session So I'm looking at London session. What are the three ways? What are the three ways that London session could move prior to New York session? So we're looking at last sessions move and we'll go ahead and just highlight The three different daily profiles that there are the first one is previous session consolidation into New session so for me that would be New York session manipulation Okay, so this is the this is the first way that price could move okay? So we have let's say London session starts right here This is when New York session starts London session opens and it's just consolidating and then boom New York session opens we see a manipulation then a reversal doing during New York session, okay? So that's the first way second way is previous session manipulation into New session reversal And again, notice that every single one of these is going to have a form of manipulation because if you guys know the way that I trade I am only trying to trade off of manipulation. Okay? Manipulation is what causes the market to move we need manipulation in order to fill orders in order for price to move in the direction that we wanted to go So with this one previous session Manipulation so let's say this is London session and let's say we have a draw on liquidity right here So during London session we're coming down we're coming down and then boom we come down and we are manipulating during the previous session, but we don't get the reversal during London session So what are we expecting New York to do give us that reversal and push price higher? Okay, and then the third way that price can move is previous session manipulation plus reversal into New session continuation, so what does that look like we actually just had an example of this yesterday I was able to make a lot of money off of it. So what does this look like London session? Oh shit, you guys weren't even able to see that low oopsies Let's go over this one one more time because I'm pretty sure I my head was in the way previous session manipulation New session reversal Okay, so let's say there's a high time frame low right here Boom we come down we come down we come down and then we finally get underneath this low and then the new session We're expecting it to reverse off of that now previous session manipulation reversal new session continuation is when we come down manipulate reverse and then we expect the new session to continue it higher now It's the same thing the opposite direction. Okay, so Boom boom. Okay, so for previous session consolidation new session manipulation and reversal Let's say we're just consolidating and then boom new session starts we manipulate reverse awesome Next one previous session manipulation New session reversal boom we're going up we take out those highs into the new session We're expecting it to reverse and then previous session manipulation reversal new session continuation we see boom the manipulation the reversal We're expecting it to continue down. So those are the three ways that market can move and I know you're probably saying well It can't be that simple. It really is that's the first thing that we're looking at We're looking at what did the previous session do did the previous session Consolidating and by consolidation it doesn't mean it just has to go sideways It just means there's no form of manipulation. Okay, because the other two profiles have a form of manipulation Whether it's manipulation without the reversal we're expecting the new session to give us the reversal Whether it's the manipulation with the reversal we're expecting the new session to continue Okay to continue that trend higher versus consolidation. There's just no manipulation of High time frame draws on liquidity. So what else do we have to be good at we have to be good at identifying draws on liquidity So on top of us identifying the previous sessions daily profiles We have to identify draws on liquidity on the high time frame we need to identify high time frame draws on liquidity What is that in that's in one hour highs and lows? four hour highs and lows and Session highs and lows and if you guys don't know About these terms like draws on liquidity high time frame liquidity One hour four hours session highs and lows I'll leave a link in the description to a five and a half hour Free course of me literally explaining every single confluence that I use within my day trading strategy So you guys can understand these confluences you guys can go and watch that video and then you guys can come right back to this So that you guys can fully understand this a little bit better So we want to be able to identify our high time frame draws on liquidity How are we going to do that? We're going to mark out the highs and lows on the one hour on the four hour and The session highs and lows so for me since I'm trading New York session I'm marking out London session highs and lows I'm marking out Asian session highs and lows and then we can also mark out previous day Previous day highs and lows as well those are good draws on liquidity. So once we've identified those draws on liquidity. We are going to Look for the daily profile that is happening Out of those draws okay, so we know what our daily profiles are We know that it's either going to consolidate and then the new session is going to manipulate the draw on liquidity and then reverse We know that it's either going to be manipulating one of these high time frame draws and liquidity already and then the new sessions going to start and then it's going to reverse or It's going to manipulate the high time frame draw on liquidity Reverse and then the new session is going to continue that trend and that is literally How I find daily bias. I know you guys are probably like it's got to be more than that It's it's not it's identifying draws on liquidity and then it's just identifying whether those draws on liquidity Have been swept yet and if they have been swept where is price going to go from there or if it hasn't been swept How can we take a trade off of it once it does get swept and price is going to move higher So this is literally all I use to find my daily vibes. I look at the daily profile I look at the previous session I identify my high time frame draws on liquidity and then from there I'm looking at what daily profile happens out of these draws on liquidity and then from there all I do is target The draws on liquidity in the other direction So I guess the last thing that we can say in terms of daily bias would be Target the draws in the other direction Because obviously if we're getting manipulation of lows and a reversal we're going to want to target what Highs why because we were able to fill orders down here where will we be able to offload those orders above highs Or where we will we be able to exit those traits above highs cool So now that we've done this take a screenshot of it take it home Give to your grandma Okay, and then we'll go ahead and apply this on the chart and you guys will see how this happens literally every single day One of these three and the reason why it happens every single day is because there's literally no other way that price could move Like this covers every single direction of price movement. It's like price either move sideways goes up or goes down I know you're probably saying whoa TJ are like obviously these are the only three daily profiles because that's the only way that price can move Yeah, exactly. So it's just identifying when we write it out and we actually can identify like hey This is what's happening and then when when we can understand what's happening following that? That's when we're actually able to start cooking all right, so now that we've done that let's get into it Oh, dude, it look we're literally having one right now I didn't think that we were going to get good price action today, but look this is actually pretty good Okay, I mean fuck it. I'll I'll show what I would be looking at today So right now I have my little session high and low indicator on here I'll leave a link in the description if you guys want these I just use it. It just makes my life way easier the red lines are Asian session highs and lows the blue lines are London session highs and lows So let's just practice with today's price action even though we had war news So prices going to be a little bit messed up. This is London session And this is Asian session We can show this on both sessions of how this of what's happening So let's say we wanted to trade London session Let's look at what Asian session did Asian session Came down and what did it do we came down and we swept out what High time frame liquidity So Asian session manipulated and then what did it do it reversed? So what are we expecting London session to do continue Asian session manipulation reversal London Continuation now Let's look at what London session did so we can make an educated guess of where New York wants to go So London session let's go ahead and mark out our hourly draws we have hourly Lows right here And see because the war news there's not really much else. There's hourly highs up here We have the Asian session highs up here We have London session lows right here And Asian session lows right here There's really not many other draws on liquidity Besides these London session highs So we marked out London session highs London session lows hourly lows hourly highs Asian session high Asian session low What did London session do? Did it manipulate any of it didn't manipulate any of those highs or lows on the high time frame? No So there was no form of manipulation during London session So what daily profile does that lead to us having going into New York session? London session consolidation New York Manipulation reversal what did New York do right when we opened? We opened and we immediately went up and did what? Sweeped out London session highs now what are we doing? We got our manipulation now. We're just going to expect some form of reversal Okay, Loki. I didn't think that today was going to be a good day good day to trade But right now it's looking pretty freaking good. Maybe we could take like a mock trade today Price is moving kind of slow anyways. We can see that this is again We see one of our daily profiles right here. What is this manipulation reversal London continuation? New York opens London what was this consolidation because it didn't sweep out any hourly draws on liquidity So there's no manipulation during London session So what do we expect New York to do and what do we see literally right when New York opens? New York opens right here We have these London session highs boom manipulation and now we're getting the reversal So this was London consolidation New York manipulation and what are we doing now? Reversing and then where can we target? boom draws on liquidity to the downside So we have boom these five minute lows these five minute lows London session lows these hourly lows Asian session lows I don't think that we're going to come all the way down to these Asian session lows because on the high time frame Us coming down and sweeping out these high time frame lows first of all It probably wasn't even expected in the first place But since we had that uh that war news candle we came down and grabbed it So you didn't ask that to take them out too No, yeah, we made an SMT divergence off of it But we can see that what we literally just talked about we just saw two of our daily profiles in the span of literally two sessions So let's do the same thing with yesterday's price action I want to keep my eye on this because this is like high key High key looking pretty good. It's looking pretty good I'm just going to keep my eye on this. I might end up taking a trade in a YouTube video That's funny. Let's go into Thursday's price action. So this is Thursday Let's go ahead and put New York market open on This is London session This is Asian session this one so beautiful So first thing that we are going to want to do is mark out our session highs and lows mark out our draws on liquidity So we have Asian session highs Asian session lows London session highs London session lows and then let's go into the hourly time frame. We have hourly highs hourly lows We have hourly highs And that's good enough So what do we do we look at the previous session what was the previous session doing boom London session opened Let's look at the draws on liquidity Does London manipulate? Well, yes, right when London session opens what does it immediately go down and do it sweeps out Asian session lows and then what does it do so we see manipulation And then what reversal also so what is this going to be New York continuation and oh would you look at that what did New York session end up doing Fucking continuing It is that fucking simple and where did it end up going to Even though we already took out these highs so we can go ahead and take that out Where did it end up going to boom hourly or Asian session high hourly high relative equal highs To our draws on liquidity Yeah So freaking good when's day we had CPI news data but we can still try and see if we had anything good I don't think we had anything. I mean no we kind of did actually yeah, we actually did Okay, so we'll go ahead and mark this out This was a high impact news day and I try and avoid trading on high impact news days Something else that we need to keep in mind is that technically at eight is when New York pre market opens Okay, so pre market opens at eight so we need to keep that in mind Mark out our draws on liquidity we mark out Asian session highs Then we mark out Asian session lows then we mark out London session lows then we mark out these are pretty much London session highs up here So So again because we had high impact news. It's a little bit iffy but It ease what it is okay. So we have Asian session highs Asian session lows London session lows London session highs and then let's go into our hourly real quick not much we have These highs right here and that's like Kind of it's these lows already got taken out during the London session. So it's kind of it So coming into this high impact news day. That's why the chart just looks so kind of like ridiculous But London session do we get any form of manipulation or yeah, I guess we I guess we did I completely blanked out But yes, we did end up coming down and sweeping out these hourly lows We have two daily profiles on this day and this isn't super typical Because those high impact news we got to move during pre market and After that. So London session opens do we get any form of manipulation? Yes, we come down and we sweep out these hourly lows Okay, so this is manipulation Do we get much of a reversal going into New York pre market open? Yes, we do we get London manipulation then we get a five minute break of structure to the upside and then boom new York pre market opens And then what do we do we continue? Okay, so we this is London manipulation reversal new York continuation And where does New York continue all the way up to boom London session highs and these Asian session highs right here And I don't really think that there were there was some four hour highs if I'm correct Over here on the left hand side Four hour highs right here four hour highs right here Yeah, so we came up and grabbed those as well So we can see and again this the only reason why New York made this move during pre market was because we had high impact news At 830 so we can see that this was London manipulation reversal and then New York pre market opened and because this was like a super drastic high impact news day The daily profile ended up playing out in in the direction during pre market But we can also see another daily profile play out once New York market opens So let's say that again, it's kind of annoying because we had a high impact news But whatever we come up we take out these highs so going into this what could this also be labeled as this can also be labeled Potentially London session consolidation New York manipulation and reversal So what do we see we see the manipulation during pre market and then we see the reversal and then by the time market opens We're probably going to want some form of like lower time frame manipulation again We had high impact news the OG daily profile of the day would have just been capturing this London manipulation reversal New York continuation up to these highs That was the main objective because we can see price kind of dies down and then chops around But we still see boom New York manipulation reversal And then again if we were able to catch entries up here We wouldn't have been stopped out and these lows end up getting hit as well Ideally we're only classifying one daily profile you don't want to be saying oh it went from London manipulation reversal New York continuation to now this it's like no that's not how the daily profiles work It's literally one per session. Okay, let's go ahead and do Tuesday Alrighty This wasn't the best price action either this past week has been kind of shitty price action In fact, I lost the majority the majority of my trades this past this past session But this is still a pretty good example Oh, yeah, and this is one thing that I wanted to clarify as well So this is a great example of the thing that I wanted to clarify and then after this you guys will be fully Covered on the device so let's look at Asian session. We have Asian session highs. We have Asian session lows. We have London session highs We have London session lows We want to look at the previous sessions. So we're looking at London session what did London session do? Well London session manipulated reverse. So what are we expecting New York session to do? Continue what does New York session do it does continue all the way up to what boom Asian session highs. Awesome The one thing that we have to be good about is understanding that if we're in A London session manipulation reversal We still have to expect some form of manipulation Even though it's a New York continuation of this trend because new money is coming into the market during New York session We have to expect some form of manipulation during the continuation phase Okay, so if we're in the daily profile of manipulation reversal continuation of the new session that we're trading we have to still be looking for some form of manipulation And I'm really glad that we did we did Tuesday or else I would have completely forgot to talk about this in this video But this is super important if we're trading a continuation daily profile Instead of looking for manipulation of high time frame draws on liquidity like sweeping out London session highs and then reversing or Sweeping out London session lows and then reversing because we're not looking for a manipulation in reversal in this session We're looking for a continuation. There still has to be manipulation It's just going to be on the lower time frames So we're going to look to mark out five minute lows and like 15 minute lows And then from there because there's new money coming into this session We can't just be entering blindly and just like buying right here right at market open We're going to get screwed over that way. There's new money coming into the market It has to manipulate the previous session in some way shape or form So what do I do when we're in a continuation setting going into a new session? I'm marking out five minute lows or I'm marking out five minute highs that we could potentially sweep So in this case we see manipulation reversal to the upside So I'm marking out five minute lows so that we can see a manipulation and then catch trades off of that Still towards our overall bias, but I'm not just pressing Buy right here because I know that new money is coming into the market and we're going to have to manipulate Just not high time frame manipulation Why because the high time frame manipulation has already happened during the previous session And we're expecting this session to continue that high time frame manipulation But we just need some more orders to be filled within this new session Okay, so let's show that example on how that happened on Tuesday So if we look at this we can see that we have these London session highs We don't care about that why because we know we are looking for new york Continuation so even though we came up and took out these London session highs right when new york market opened We're not looking for new york manipulation and reversal we're looking for new york Continuation why because London manipulated reversed So what do we expect new york to do to move higher How is it going to move higher we need to have some form of manipulation so we can go ahead and go on the 15 minute and mark out highs and lows so we have boom 15 minute lows right here and this is again a perfect example of this We have a 15 minute low right here 15 minute low right here What does price do this was happened a little bit later in the day again Not the best price action, but it's still like this is still 100% true and shows our daily profiles work every single day We come down we sweep out these this 15 minute low We sweep out this 15 minute low and then boom what does price end up going to do? fulfill Boom these Asian session highs We can also go on the five minute and mark out five minute lows. Okay, so we have a five minute low right here We have five minute low right here five minute low right here. Okay, we go through and sweep all of these out And then boom what do we end up doing? fulfilling that continuation of this new york session to the upside and just like that You guys understand how to find daily bias if you guys were sort of confused if you guys still have questions And you're just like man, I wish TJR would be able to talk to me one-on-one or be able to answer my questions Or I wish there was like a profitable trader that I could talk to every single day or send a fucking text message to I am giving you guys access to that I'll leave a little link in the description if you guys want to become one of my students If you guys want to be able to get on coaching calls with me and other profitable traders because I know these videos can only do so much for you guys as traders I'm sure that you guys have questions and I can only make These daily bias videos these liquidity sweep videos these strategy videos For what I'm assuming that you guys are struggling with and hopefully you guys find the value that you guys need from these YouTube videos But if you guys still need specific questions if you guys still want specific trading on your day trading and you guys are like man If I can just talk to TJR or if I can just talk to other profitable traders that have already been through these mistakes that I can literally just speed run through all of these things Get over all the mistakes that TJR made get through all the mistakes that other profitable traders had made in order to get to where they're at and just go through the process much faster You guys can become my student you guys can get on these coaching calls with me You guys can get on coaching calls with other profitable traders you guys get full access to a profitable trader literally 24-7 Access to chat with them and answer all of your guys's questions because I know you know these videos only come out like once or twice a week So it's hard and maybe I'm not answering your very specific trading questions and I would love to do that It's just within the blueprint so with that being said I'll leave a little link in the description down there for you guys to sign up to that for you guys to become my student I love and appreciate you guys. I'll catch you guys in the next video. Hopefully this helped you guys. Peace out

Again, with literally zero dollars, so we're going to start off with how you guys can even make money at first, or like when you guys are trying to learn trading, like what you should be doing on the back end, so you can start building up capital. We're going to be talking about potential jobs that you can do because again, not every single job is going to be good for a up and coming day trader. Then from there, I'm going to introduce the tools and the resources that you guys need in order to, again, get going with day trading because if you guys are just working a job and then not trading, you aren't going to make any money trading. And then from there, I'm going to show you guys how you guys can actually start learning the skill of day trading with those tools and with those resources so that you guys can not only be trading while making money on the side, but also not risking money in the markets and still working on that skill. So there's such thing as demo accounts where you guys are trading with fake money, where you guys can help grow that skill, update trading. And then last but not least, I'm going to show you guys how you guys can eventually deploy that capital into a live account and show you guys some different strategies that I use when I was first started day trading and different companies that you can use to help extend your capital, grow your capital, all that good stuff. So that once you guys actually have the skill of day trading, then to be able to actually use that capital in a smart way. So you guys can capitalize on it and leverage it to your best abilities. So with that being said, let's get into it. Okay, so step number one is going to be if you guys have zero dollars in your bank account, what the fuck are you going to do? You need to start making money and even though you're not going to eventually be risking money to help build the skill of day trading, eventually you're going to need money to make money within the markets. So the first thing that you guys are going to want to do is find a job that is easy for you to be able to learn the skill of day trading. And I know that's super vague, but for me that was door dashing and that was doing like Uber eats and stuff like that because I was my own boss and I could choose my own schedule. So if I wanted to trade at New York Stock Exchange open at 9.30 a.m. Eastern time, I was like, okay, cool. I'm just not going to work during that time. I'm going to grind on trading and then once that's said and done, then boom, I can get to work and I could start making money. Most of you guys probably won't have that luxury and most of you guys will be working a standard 9 to 5 job. Back when I was in college, which I would consider like similar to a 9 to 5 job instead of just like students. And unfortunately for me, I wasn't necessarily like making money during that time. But for me, because that main area like New York Stock Exchange open was blocked off by classes or whatever other conflicts I had, I had to trade London session, which was really late at night for me. But again, at the end of the day, you guys are going to have to make small sacrifices, including sleep when you guys are trying to actually take yourself to the next level. And trust me, those sleepless nights, they are eventually going to pay off because for me, I used to trade London session, but now you see me, I'm financially free and I'm able to trade whatever session I want because I now have the skill of trading. So I was sacrificing sleep in order to be able to trade London session in order to grow that skill. And I think some of you guys should do the same. But again, that's only if you guys have a 9 to 5 job. Again, if you guys don't have a job right now, but if you guys are looking to build capital, I would highly recommend you guys find some sort of side hustle that you guys can quickly start making money like today. I'm not saying go try and start another dropshipping store like no, that's going to take way too much time. And that's like way too much of a learning curve for you guys to start making money. I'm talking about you guys need to start making money right now because you have bills to pay, you have mouths to feed. Okay, if you guys have a family, we need to start working on collecting capital right now, not learning some other skill to eventually make you money. That's what day trading is going to be. All right, so now that we figured out what job is going to be most beneficial for you guys to start day trading. And again, no harm, no foul. If you guys are working at 9 to 5, that's fine. Again, you guys are just going to have to sacrifice some sleep. You guys are going to have to sacrifice some free time. But at the end of the day, there's a reason why only 1% of traders end up turning profitable. It's because they're willing to do what 99% of people are willing to do. And that's going to lead us into the very next thing, which is going over the free tools and resources that you guys actually need in order to start learning about day trading. Okay, so we covered the job. Now we got to go over the tools and the resources that are actually going to help you guys build that skill. So with that being said, we're going to get on to the charts. We're going to get into my office and we're going to break down all the tools and resources that you guys need in order to get started. All right, what is good? So this is going to be the first free tool and resources that is going to help you guys out when starting to get into day trading. This is going to be trading view. If you guys have seen any of my trade recap videos, if you see me marking up charts, it's always on trading view. Literally every single trader in the entire world, unless they're a weirdo, uses trading view. Okay, and there's a reason for that. They have been in the game for the longest. They're the most touted company when it comes to day trading charts and just charting in general. Their software is just better than everything else. Okay, so you're going to be a little bit overwhelmed at first. You're going to see like all of these different things. First of all, you guys don't have to at least at the beginning, again, pay any money for a subscription. That's the awesome thing about trading view. You guys can all start with just a completely free membership and you guys can write on that completely free membership forever. Obviously for me, I pay for certain things like to be able to have multiple screens up at once and to be able to set multiple alerts. But you guys don't need that, especially when you guys are first starting to learn how to day trade. At the end of the day, all you need is the charts. You don't need no indicators. You don't need no alerts. You don't need multiple screens up. Okay, all of that shit that they put up on the internet, it's a lie. Okay, you just need straight up trading view charts. Okay, so let's jump into these charts real quick and I can break down what some of the tools are going to do for us. And how you guys can actually get started on chart work. Okay, so this is trading view.com. I just clicked on the S&P 500 and again, this may seem overwhelming for you. You're going to look at all this and you're going to think you're a fucking genius. I don't know how you add it. It's going up a little bit no, bro. You're not a genius. Keep fucking door dashing for now. Okay, because when we pull this bitch up, it's going to get really overwhelming. Yeah, you have no clue where this bitch is going right now. But don't worry, we're going to cover how you guys can understand where this bitch is going eventually. All right, the first main thing that I would want you guys to learn to understand on trading view is just all of these tools. So these tools are going to be super beneficial for you. Again, we can draw shit on the chart and make it seem like it's going to work for us. But at the end of the day, if we don't know where price is going to go and if we don't know what any of these candlesticks and chart patterns mean, then we're screwed. And we're never going to be able to make money from trading. So with that being said, I gave you guys a really awesome free resource. It's a free course for you guys to help understand all of these chart patterns. And look, I'm not a pattern trader. Okay, I trade based off of price action. So it's price movements. You can see that I don't have any indicators. I don't have any volume. Okay, I'm literally just reading the Japanese candlesticks. Okay, I've got all these different time frames. And I know that price is fractal. So again, sorry, we're using big words. I know that what happens on every single time frame on every single candlestick chart happens on every other chart. If that makes any sense whatsoever, I know this is a little bit overwhelming right now, but price moves the same way on every single time frame chart. So I know that when price is seeking out liquidity, it's going to be seeking out liquidity not only on the one hour time frame, but also on the one minute time frame. And I explain all of that. And if that seems overwhelming, don't worry. It won't be overwhelming. Once you guys go through my free course explaining how you guys can actually read these candlesticks like the back of your fucking hand and understand where price wants to go consistently. Okay, so boom, trading view is going to be the very first tool that you guys need in order to get started going over the charts. And to actually get started on your day trading journey, just getting set up on this, get familiar with all of these different tools. I'm frequently using the horizontal ray tool. I'm frequently using the rectangle tool. And again, it's going to be used to mark out those confluences that tell me exactly where price is going to go and all of those confluences. I explain to you guys how to use them, how to identify them in my free course. And I'll leave a little link in the description right now. The next best free tool for your guys is trading is going to be YouTube. Okay, people undervalue free content way too much, especially within the education space. Because they think, oh, if this person's going to give it out to me for free, why should I value it? And in turn, just like humans naturally devalue free stuff. And the best place to learn about day trading for free is, you know what I'm saying? You're watching him, okay? So we're going to go ahead and view this channel. What? No way. This guy is fucking nasty at his craft. And I have, bro, by far the most amount of videos than any other day trader on the internet on day trading. I post literally the trade recaps of every single trade that I take, whether it's a win, whether it's a loss. And I tell you guys exactly how much I make and exactly how much I loss. And then on top of that, I have playlists full of shit. Like we got the trading transformation. We got the crypto bootcamp. We got the regular bootcamp. 56 freaking videos explaining to you guys how to day trade. Okay? And then on top of that, 37 videos explaining to you guys how to day trade. And then on top of that, 67 videos explaining different concepts on how to day trade. And then 103 videos of trade recaps teaching you guys about every single trade that I take. Okay? So you guys should not be devaluing this free content. This is by far like essentially all information that you need in the entire world is going to be on YouTube for free. Like that's literally just how the shit works. There's so much information circulating throughout the entire world. But I can promise you every single piece of information, especially about day trading is going to be free for you guys online on YouTube. And my channel biased is one of the best. I mean, look, I just hit 400,000 subscribers today. It's for a fucking reason. Okay? Because I'm really good at teaching. But I'm on top of that. I'm also really good at trading. Okay? So go. Subscribe to this channel and just start binging all of my videos because I can promise you after you guys go through the free course, after you guys go through the bootcamp, after you guys go through the trading transformation, after you guys go through all of the trade recaps, you guys are going to be on another level, compared to everybody else that goes and buys a bullshit ass course where they learn literally everything that I teach in the boot camp for free. Okay. Now, you guys are probably thinking, okay, like I'm getting spammed with all this information right now. I know where the education is coming from. Okay? I know I get TJR's free course and watch all of TJR's YouTube videos. But when I'm watching the shit, how do I actually practice the skill that you told me? I have to be practicing. So we're going to take this back to our handy dandy trusted friend, trading view. Okay? And this is where you guys are going to be able to open up a demo account. So this was an account that I was telling you guys about where you guys are going to be able to trade with literally, I mean, you're going to be able to trade with up to 10 million dollars. Does that sound good to you? Do you want a free 10 million dollars? We'll sign up to the link in my bio. No, I'm kidding. But you guys can hypothetically trade with 10 million dollars if you want using the demo account. So demo account is essentially fake money so that you guys can practice learning the skill of day trading in live markets in real time without risking your money. Doesn't that sound amazing? You're able to practice a skill that requires money to be able to learn and actually actually get the reward. But instead, they're saying, look, bro, practice this shit first. And then from there, once you know that you have the skill, then you can actually start risking your money because you'd be an idiot. You would be an idiot if you started day trading immediately with all that harder money that we just taught you guys how to save up. Okay, so you guys are probably wondering why are you in the top right hand corner? I'm going to explain. Okay, so down here, there's going to be all this different shit. Okay, you guys are going to want to open the trading panel. And from here, there's going to be a whole bunch of different brokers. When you guys are learning how to day trade and when you guys are on a demo account, like obviously, you know, I could recommend a bunch of different brokerages so you guys can start demo trading. But ideally at the end of the day, like you don't, it doesn't really matter who you're demo trading through. It only matters choosing a broker when you're actually putting money at risk. And I have a bunch of different videos talking about what brokerage brokerages I use and I talk about it all the time on every single other video. But anyways, this is going to show you guys how to open up a demo account. The easiest way that you guys can do it is literally just click trading view paper trading. You click connect and then boom, we're in there. And then I got this account called LeBron. Okay, and we have $100,000 in this account. Unfortunately, the market is close today. Shout out Martin Luther King. Sorry. But shout out MLK. He had a dream and his dream was for you to be able to turn profitable. But once we set this up, we can see, okay, we got $100,000 in our bank account, or not in our bank account, in our account balance. We can go ahead and shrink this back down. But we can see these buttons that previously weren't here before are finally here. So again, let's imagine that the market's open. I don't even think I'll be able to place a trade because it is a bank holiday. But when we are practicing trading, I can put myself down here now. When we're practicing trading and when we learn all of the concepts and confluences that I taught you about in the free course and in my bootcamp and in all of those amazing videos that I gave you guys for free on YouTube because I'm just the best. You guys are going to be able to know how to execute trades. So let's say, again, this is a horrible idea, but let's just say, oh yeah, we want to take a buy position off of this fair value gap. If you don't know what a fair value gap is, you better start studying my free course. Okay, and so you're just going to go ahead and click here. And this is super awesome. Okay, we can see the units, what percent risk we want to do. Okay, we can even set the risk that we want. Let's say we only want to risk $1,000, which is what even is that? 1% of our account and our take profit is going to be like 100 ticks. 100 ticks and our stop loss is going to be another 100 ticks. Oops, buggy. Let's do that. Cool. We're risking 1.25% of our account and our take profit is 100 ticks and our stop loss is 100 ticks. So if we win this trade, then we'll make 1,250 bucks. And if we lose this trade, we will lose 1,250 bucks. Okay, and then from there, you guys are just going to go ahead and press buy. Okay, obviously the order got rejected because the market is closed right now. However, if you guys were live on actual live market conditions, your position would go through. And then same thing with sales. Okay, again, when you guys go through my free course, I'm going to explain to you guys exactly how and where and why I'm entering off of certain confluences and when I'm going to be looking to trade and it's going to help you guys a lot. So again, please go through that before just spamming this and having fun with it. But again, you guys should low-key treat this like a video game because at the end of the day, day trading is just a video game with by far the best point system. The best point system is fucking hell of bread. So again, like I know a bunch of people that transition from being professional gamers to being professional day traders because it's just another game. Okay, if you guys can understand that, hey, if we can gamify this and the money is just like numbers on a screen and you're not emotional about it, then boom, you guys can get really good about this. And on top of that, we can literally make the money be zero dollars and make it just numbers on the screen by starting off on a demo account, which is exactly what I'm showing you guys. So again, let's say we want to take a cell position. It would be the same thing. We press cell and then again, of course, the order is going to reject because market is closed right now. But that's how you guys set up a demo account. Now assuming this is going to be a pause, I'm going to break down what your guys' thought process should be before you guys move into an actual live account. So a lot of you guys trust me, I've been there before. You guys are going to convince yourself that you guys are ready for a live account far before any of you guys are actually ready for a live account. So this is what I always say. You guys are going to forever be on demo until you guys can prove to yourself. And honestly, we shouldn't even be proving it to ourselves. You got to prove it to your brother or prove it to your dad or prove it to your mom because sometimes we get a little bit ego-driven and trust me, I have been there before. And I made all of these mistakes so you guys don't have to. I'm telling you guys don't make them the same mistakes that I did because I ended up losing literally six figures worth of money by not following this and by not building the skill on demo first. So build the skill on demo and then prove to yourself your mom, your dad, your brother that after three months straight of profitability. So that again, that doesn't mean you guys get on demo and then after three months, boom, perfect, we can go run our money up. No, that's not what we're doing. Okay, we are practicing on demo while running up that bread with our job. And while we're practicing, we're stacking capital. Again, we're not blowing it on dumb shit. We're not doing any dumb shit. We're locked in right now because we're trying to learn this skill that's going to change our life forever. Okay, and when you guys are doing that, you guys are going to be trading on demo. The only time that you actually start risking that hard earned capital that you guys have been working your ass off off of all those jobs that I just told you guys about. Okay, the only time that you guys are going to risk that capital is going to be after three straight months of green. Okay, so it's not after your first three months. If you have one winning month, then a losing month, then another winning month, I don't care. Start over. Okay, it's got to be three green months in a row. That means boom, 10% gain, boom, 5% gain, boom, 7% gain. Okay, I trust you, but I still don't trust you a lot. But once you've gotten to that point, you guys, it's best for you guys to switch over to a live account or to start trading on a pro firm. And that's what I'll get into the into the into the next segment. How you guys can leverage your money so that you guys can actually make far more profits. Because again, if you guys are working like kind of these minimum wage type of jobs, by the time you guys are done and like prove to yourself that you guys are profitable, you guys probably only have like a thousand or a couple thousand dollars saved up, especially if you guys are like feeding in a family and stuff like that. So we need to think how can we leverage this one thousand, two thousand, three thousand dollars to the best of our abilities so that we not only can leverage our skill of day trading, but also leverage the capital that we've been working our ass off for. But keep in mind, when you guys do end up going into live trading, I'm I can promise you you're not going to pass your first funded account. I can promise you you guys will probably go unprofitable for a bit because there's going to be this newfound emotion that you guys are going to have after going on to a live account. That's the biggest difference between trading on demo where it truly is just numbers on a screen to a live account where it's no longer numbers on a screen. It's hours of work that you put in door dashing or hours of work that you put in working for your annoying ass boss. And that's when you start getting emotional about the numbers on the screen. And we can't let that happen. And there's a bunch of psychology videos that I can teach you guys to help boost your psychology so that you guys don't fall into this trap. But at the end of the day, I kind of know that you guys are going to fall into this trap. But we need to we need to kick that almost immediately. And we're going to sacrifice some money at the very beginning to get past that to get past that psychological barrier. And then once we're past that psychological barrier, we're going to be able to cook and actually make money. So with that being said, let's get into once we prove to ourselves that we're profitable on demo, how do we actually start risking money? Again, that hard-earned money that we've been working for and be able to leverage it so that we can make the most amount of money and capitalize on this opportunity that the markets are giving us. All right. So the first way that you guys are going to be able to leverage your money in day trading after you guys have proven to yourself that you guys are profitable traders is going to be through funded accounts. Now let me just break down what a funded account is as if you guys are just a dumbass because most of you guys are. But that's okay. I'm a dumbass too and I can make money in trading. So that's not stopping you guys. I'm just kind of we're going based off the the below average IQ here. Let's say I'm a trader just like you guys after going through my free course, I'm like, hell yeah, I'm profitable. I can do it. I can make money in the markets and I believe in myself. I'm willing to bet money on it. But I'm thinking I'm not willing to put that thousand dollars that I saved up for the past month all in on one account. Just for me, you know, if I only make 10% in a month on a thousand dollars, I'm only making a hundred bucks. That's not where I'm not going to retire with trading. I'm not going to be able to be financially free with trading. No, but there's companies that will help you get capital to be able to prove yourself for you guys eventually be able to trade with much higher capital. Okay. So right here, we have a list of a bunch of companies and a bunch of pro firms. It's a proprietary trading firm that helps you guys leverage your money to prove to them that you are profitable just like you prove to yourself that you were profitable on demo. You have to pass a challenge, a trading challenge where they're let's just go to FTMO's website, for example, let's pull up FTMO. So this is FTMO quite possibly and definitely the biggest pro firm within the space and they have been in the pro firm space for the longest amount of time ever. Okay. And this is essentially what it looks like. So again, let's say I'm a trader that doesn't have any money and says, hey, I think I'm a profitable trader, but I don't want to spend a thousand dollars just to only make a hundred dollars in a month. And then again, like 10% in a month is really good. So instead, I say I want to have $200,000 to trade with. Okay. So what FTMO, the company says is they say, okay, cool. You are going to have to pass two challenges. The first challenge is just a step by step. You are not allowed to lose $10,000 within a day. So that's you're not allowed to lose $5,000 within one day, which makes sense. Because again, if you guys go through all like pause that, if you guys are a profitable trader, you are not going to be risking 5% in a day. Okay. And especially if you guys are a smart risk on trader, you guys aren't going to be risking 5% in a day. And then on top of that, you guys aren't allowed to lose $20,000 total. Okay. Or else the count challenge, boom, it's gone. And then boom, the money that you saved up, it's gone. It's wasted. It's gone forever. Okay. But that makes sense because they're saying the maximum loss is 10%. Okay. And your profit target is just 10%. So as long as you don't lose 5% in a day, and as long as you don't lose 10% total, and as long as you're able to make 10% total, then you go to the next challenge. The next challenge is super simple. It's the same exact thing, except instead of having to make $20,000, so 10%, you only have to make 5%. Okay. And then the next step is boom, you're funded with them. And now you're trading on essentially a $200,000 account where you are able to potentially get a payout of the money that you're making on this pro firm. So that's a super cool thing about these things is when you guys get into it, you're essentially leveraging your $1,000 because this is approximately like $1,000. It's a little bit more, but you're leveraging your $1,000 that you have. And instead of having the potential to only make $100 and a month, which is 10%, right, of $1,000, you are going to be proving yourself to this company that, hey, I am a profitable trader. I'm going to go through this challenge. I'm going to pass it, go through the second challenge. I'm going to pass it. And then on the third step, you're actually on an account where you can make money. So yes, you know, you pay $1,000 and maybe both of these challenges take you like two months to pass. But that's two months that I'm willing to wait, especially if I've proved to myself that I'm profitable to get to the third step of being able to make literally like $20,000 in a month, instead of $100 in a month. So yes, you're delaying that reward, but buy delaying that reward and buy waiting until you're actually profitable. Because if you're not profitable, trust me, there's no reason to gamble on this shit. If you're an unprofitable trader, you should not be, you should not be attempting to pass these challenges. They're built for unprofitable traders to not be able to pass them because this company isn't dumb enough to be able to pass unprofitable traders and then get them on here. You know, like that's just not how the system works. Okay. So you have to be profitable in order to pass this. And it's just, it's just not going to happen if you're unprofitable. So you have to prove to yourself that first. But once you're able to do that, and you're able to get to step three, bro, that $1,000 can turn into $20,000 over the course of three months. I'm willing to do that instead of putting my $1,000 into a live account and only making like $300 at the end of three months. That's the best way to leverage your money. Once you guys can actually go through all those steps, find a job that works for day trading so you can work on the skill, get all the free resources that helps you guys learn the skill. And then on top of that, go through all the influences, go through all the strategy and go through all of the stuff that I teach you guys on my YouTube, in my free course, in my bootcamp. Okay. And then actually going and applying it on demo, proving to yourself that you're profitable, and then you're going to be able to leverage your money so that you guys can start making like boom, bro, imagine going from making only $1,000 a month or saving $1,000 a month to now you're up $20,000 in a single month. And yes, this is going to take a long time for you guys to get to this point. But it's not super far out of reach. And trust me, I know because I've been in your position before. I literally, I did the door dash shit while I was trying to pass funded accounts. I did that shit. Okay. And eventually, after a long enough period of time, it started fucking working and I started fucking printing in day trading. And then it got to the point where it's like, boom, let's say I pass this account and then I get a $20,000 payout. I no longer have to be working that door dash job because now I have this safety net to be able to pay all my bills for months on end. So even if I failed this account after that first $20,000 payout, not only do I have the capital to buy more challenges and keep going, but I also have the free time to be able to continuously work on my craft to get to one become a better trader to be able to pass these challenges easier and to be able to make more money from these challenges. And then the then from there, it's exponential for you guys like the second that you guys quit your job and the second that you guys get a payout or the second that you guys can start funding a live account with like $10,000. Now instead of only making $100 a month, if you guys can fund a live account with $10,000, now you're making $1,000 a month. What happens if you stack up five of these payouts on top of each other? That's $100,000. And you better not be dumb and blow it on a watcher, blow it on a new car, you better put that and reinvest it into yourself and you reinvest it into a live account because now, because you always have the possibility of failing this, okay? There's still rules on here once you guys pass both these challenges, okay? So that's the one limitation and the one downside to funded accounts. But once you guys have a ton of capital in your live account, that's when financial freedom starts because if you guys have $100,000 in your live account, now you're making $10,000 a month consistently and there's no rules here so you guys can be a little bit more free flowing with the trading and on top of that after that, like once you've accumulated six figures in trading payouts, like, bro, you're set for a while and you're actually able to instead of working your ass off on that job that you guys fucking hate to be able to get you guys into this position, you guys are then going to exchange that time that you guys spent working on that job to working on your new job, which is day trading. All right guys, now you guys have the fucking sauce, all right?

I'm going to be breaking down literally everything when it comes to mindset Risk management strategy understanding confluence is understanding where price wants to go at certain times understanding why the chart is moving at certain times Understanding where price wants to go all of these things that are going to help you guys make money from the markets And all of this stuff took me countless hours of trial and error and it kind of led to this one big culmination of all of these videos that I put out online Every single video that I put out online is to help you guys become a better day trader whether it's mistakes that I've made in the past Whether it's videos that I wish I had as an unprofitable trader back when I was starting and the goal with this video is to put it all in one place So that you guys can just have this fast track to profitability so that you guys don't have to look anywhere else when it comes to Finding any sort of day trading education. This is essentially just going to be your guys's free course Free guide to becoming a profitable day trader in 2025 and that's exactly why the majority of traders fail You guys always hear the statistic of day trading is too hard day trading doesn't work And that's not the case. It's the majority of day traders actually end up giving up They don't end up failing failing comes with any new skill every time I attempted to take my first trade or a couple first trades I suck that it just like any other skill if you try and pick up a basketball for the first time You're going to suck every skill takes trial and error just like day trading does and that's where a lot of people get caught up They think that they're going to get rich tomorrow They think that they're going to get rich within the next month That's not the case and something that sucks with day trading and honestly all these other side hustles within the online money space Is that it's very difficult to find all the right information and compile it into one single video or just put it into a playlist for you guys to be able to learn What you guys are supposed to and tune out all the noise and all the BS that's online because there's a lot of it That's circulating the web and you guys can get super confused You guys can mix up strategies you guys can mix up influences and in turn it takes you guys a lot longer To be able to turn profitable So the goal with this video is to put everything all the good information in one video that you guys can just press play and watch it Start to finish and have all the education Necessary for you guys to turn profitable and that is my goal with this video Just putting everything in one place for you guys. I'm so excited for this video because it's going to be an absolute banger I'm taking every little piece of knowledge that I've dropped throughout the years of me being on YouTube And just putting it in one place and it's literally just going to be a full A to Z guide on how you guys Can crush day trading going into 2025 so before we get into these first couple videos that we are going to compile for you guys to help understand What day trading really is I need to readjust what your guys headspace is when you guys are going into learning how to day trade because a lot of people Kind of misconstrue what they think day trading is they think that they're going to jump right into it And they're just instantly going to make money that is not the case just like how I was explaining before day trading is a skill Just like anything else you guys are going to suck at it at first And you guys are going to be really horrible at it at first, but that's okay As long as we are making these mistakes and then learning from them never making those mistakes again That's how we're going to grow So I don't want you guys to come into this just thinking holy shit This is going to turn me profitable today once I grind through However long this is going to be like 15 hours or 20 hours worth of content But you guys need to keep in mind that all of the education within here is going to help you guys stay on the right path Towards profitability and the problem with a lot of these other day trading gurus online or with all these other day trading videos online Is there saying like hey this one strategy will turn you profitable in five minutes And then you guys go and watch that video and then you're like okay cool Let me go apply this and then you guys lose your first fucking 10 trades and you're like god damn it Why didn't I turn profitable in five minutes like the video said I was going to so I need to Re-shift your guys's headspace and help you guys understand what day trading really is how we can actually get good at the skill And put you guys in the correct headspace when you guys are going into this education. So first of all what is the goal of trading? It's not to make money every single one of you guys probably thinking oh day trading is to make money No day trading is about finding and being able to get into the marketplace and accurately predict with a high probability on a daily basis where price wants to go So again, let's repeat that What is day trading day trading is getting into the markets on a daily basis and being able to accurately predict with a High probability where price wants to go and the awesome side effect of that is making money now if that's our main goal There's two sides of this goal one make money with trader that is going to lead you guys to take actions to get results That you guys are not going to like which is losing a whole bunch of money because if you guys get into the market every single day And just think how can I make money? You're going to be placing trade after trade after trade after trade after trade and you guys are going to end up losing money Versus if you guys go into the markets with the headspace of how can I predict where price wants to go? Using the conferences and using the strategy and using the headspace and using the risk management that I'm going to teach you guys in this video Then that changes the game a little bit where instead of us thinking I want to make money right now You are thinking how can I predict with a high probability where price wants to go today? It's going to help you guys avoid taking trades that you guys shouldn't be taking And it's also going to encourage you guys to be taking trades that you guys should be taking and then in turn What is that going to lead us to the awesome side effect of being able to predict price action which is money It's just like any other skill but with trading There's a super strong correlation with money where it's like you are risking money on this trade And you are either going to make money or lose money We need to detach ourselves from that and instead be thinking when we get into the markets We are not trying to make money We are just trying to predict where price wants to go and by thinking like that It's going to help us stay away from taking trades that we shouldn't be taking And it's going to encourage us to take trades that we should be taking and on top of that It's going to help us get over the speed bumps that we are going to face again Like I was saying this isn't going to be help you guys get rich quick in one day or one week or one month This is going to be a long time in order to grow and build this skill of day trading And hopefully you guys can understand that I'm not going to get on here and BS you guys and say that you guys are going to be able to get rich Right after this video. That's not the case Okay, I'm going to keep it real with you guys You guys are going to have to digest all this content and then from there apply it make mistakes Learn from those mistakes and that's how you guys are going to grow as a trader And that's how you guys are going to be able to accurately predict price action with higher probability Instead of just thinking I want to make money today There's no room for growth in that because it's either make money or lose money So if you're just getting into the market saying I want to make money or getting into trading saying I want to make money You're in it for the wrong reasons because what is the core of day trading? It's predicting where price wants to go like I was saying before that's going to help us avoid a lot of these early beginner mistakes That a lot of you guys are going to face So in order to get good at trading We need to instantly shift that in our head and that's what I'm going to cover in all of these videos that we're just going to dump You guys straight into to be able to shift your guys headspace from I want to make money with trading And instead get into how can I predict price action consistently on a daily basis with a high probability And then the side effect of that is money. It's just like any other skill If I want to make a lot of money as a basketball player What do I have to be good at? I have to be good at putting the ball in the hoop I have to be good at dribbling I have to be good at passing If you want to make money as a basketball player You don't think how can I make more money playing basketball You think how can I get better at basketball and then in turn what's the side effect of that? You make more money So it's the same thing with trading so we need to detach ourselves from thinking trading is about making money No trading is about getting good at trading Okay, and in turn just like any other skill once you get good at a skill There's a high and awesome reward at the end of the fucking rainbow Okay, and hopefully this video is going to help you guys get to where you guys want to go So keep that in mind when we go into all of these videos This is what your guys headspace should be when you guys are getting into these first initial videos that I'm going to dump on you guys So with that being said, let's jump right into it This is kind of going to be like a primer to help you guys get your mind right and help you guys understand What it tastes to become a profitable trader before we can even get into any sort of education because a lot of you guys are going to come into this Thinking education is what I need I just need to learn more. I need to learn the strategy. I need to learn this I need to learn that and it's not the case strategies is honestly like far from the determining factor of you guys being profitable or not and the real determining factor is going to be time and consistency in the way that you act in the way that you operate so What I kind of like to talk about is skills we can treat trading as a skill where I love using this analogy If you tell a basketball player or sit sit someone who's never played basketball down Before and tell them you know every single day for a month long They have to watch an hour long video of basketball training videos So they don't get a basketball they just have to sit down and they just watch these training videos going over the basics dribbling a ball shooting a ball and you know between the legs behind the back lay up jump shot Free pointer whatever right and then at the end of that month you give them a ball and you have them play basketball right They're going to be at a certain level after watching those videos and then on the contrary if you give Just another another person who's never played basketball in their entire life give them a ball and say look You know you have an entire month and you have a single hour every single day And you just have to figure this out figure it out, you know, they've never played basketball They don't know how it works But they have to figure it out all they know is the rules and you know what they're supposed to do Odds are the person that has the basketball and is able to practice in a And just learn from mistakes over and over again is going to be in a lot better position than the person who just sat on their ass Watching basketball skill videos Which now leads me to how this correlates to trading It's the same thing. It's the same thing as a skill where if we sit down a trader and we say hey look watch this month long Watch this month long series or you know this literally year long series of me teaching you guys How to trade concepts on trading and if you guys don't apply it if you guys don't practice it You guys won't get any wonder if you guys just watch it and like think that you're learning stuff by watching it And then like the next day you just like boom try and apply it and instantly expect success You're not going to be successful Versus if you guys were to just sit your ass down sitting in front of the chart And practice and drill You know, maybe you guys don't even nest like again. Let's apply this to trading. Let's have you say someone down and say hey just watch Again for a month you have an hour each day and you guys are going to watch trading videos and then You know, boom see how they see how they act in the market and then we have another person Who's never done trading in their entire life and the person just sits them down and says figure it out You have an hour each day for a month long I guarantee you without a doubt in my mind that the person who who has to actually be trading live trading Is going to be a better trader because they're going to start seeing patterns repetitions within the market They're going to fail and they are going to learn from it So what happens when we can combine the two what happens when we can watch videos that are helpful that teach us skills That can hopefully get us over some of those beginner mistakes some of those beginner failures that we have And then along with drilling it in learning We are going to be a great trader Similarly with the basketball analogy if we give them the opportunity to sit down during that month and watch an hour long of tutorial videos on beginner videos of People playing basketball and then right after that they get an hour to practice it into drill it They're going to be a lot better than those two people who only had one of each And it's the same thing with trading. Okay, so if I teach you guys a A strategy or if I teach you guys concepts or if I teach you guys or if I give you guys a lesson It's not as simple as just sitting down and digesting the YouTube video and writing notes on it Because that's just step one Step two is actually taking action and practicing it and repeating it and I feel like that's what that's this whole that people get sucked into is this YouTube Just black hole of information where they sit down and they watch every single two billion ict videos and they never end up applying it and the only time that they try and apply it is when market opens And they only get like one shot because they hear tjr or they hear ict say hey only take one to two trades one to two trades today And then it's like wow, so we're consuming way more than we're practicing and that's the biggest issue we need to be practicing Almost equally with consuming and then we get to the point where we've consumed everything that we need possible because it's same thing with same thing with trader And basketball okay, if we think about basketball the best basketball players in the world The skills that they have They're just really good at the basics We think you know what makes Stefan Curry one of the best players in the world He's just really insanely good at shooting the basketball if if we compare Stefan Curry to one of the globe traitors the globe traitors Are arguably Have better more crazy skills But they're not as good at shooting as Stefan Curry It's the same thing I've heard this analogy before as being healthy if you want to get healthy Stop trying to look in the one percent and look at the 99 percent if you want to get healthy that special running shoe Isn't going to make you healthier that little Whoop bracelet on your wrist that tracks your heart rate that trait that tracks everything Isn't going to make you healthier what's going to make you healthier four things sleep working out hydration and Eating healthy those four things if you do those four things really really well You're going to be one of the healthiest people ever and it's the same exact thing with trading So if you guys can just understand the basics Which is what I'm going to be teaching you guys here And honestly like throughout all of this I'm going to be teaching you guys everything But it's going to get to the point where you guys again like I was saying in the first video where you guys can kind of pull away And be like look I think I have everything possible. I think I have everything that I need Where you guys have to step away and then just practice and practice and practice and fail over and over and over and over again Another analogy that I like to use is a construction worker a really bad construction worker versus a really good construction worker If we give the really bad construction worker a toolbox and blueprints and all the tools necessary to build a house And it's the first time building a house ever in their entire life They're going to build a really shitty house Versus if you give a really good construction worker whose bill whose built millions of houses before that same toolbox Those same tools and the same blueprint they are going to build that house much better than that construction Then that shitty construction worker and the only difference is repetition So if we think about that shitty construction worker the first house that they build Well, boom, boom, boom, it's going to be really bad And they're going to be like man that was horrible There's a bunch of things that I can work on and I can identify the things that I can work on Maybe I sit down and I watch the really good construction worker and see okay. What did you do here? What did you do here? Okay, got it got it got it boom Build the second house boom boom boom boom boom. It's a little bit better than the first house, but it still sucks And then he builds five houses and they're all and they continuously get better than that first house house that he built And then he builds a thousand houses and they're in that thousand taths is going to be so much better than the first house that he built And then the 10,000 house is going to be so much better than that thousands house house that he's built So it's not the tools that are the issue. It's not the concepts in trading. That's the issue. It's not the strategy in trading. That's the issue It's the repetition and it's the practice. That's the issue. It's the time that's the issue You guys are lacking time and you guys are RELACKING repetition within the market and that's our biggest issue That's it this video is going to be rather short because I need you guys to understand this concept Because I'm going to continue trying to provide value because right now I'm a good construction worker and you guys are bad construction workers Right, you guys are unprofitable. If you guys are watching this you guys have never traded before you guys are on your first house I'm going to lay out tools for you guys. I'm going to give you guys your toolbox And then I'm going to give you guys your blueprint Through strategy through confluence, but I can only give you guys those pieces I can't force you guys to build your houses You guys have to take it upon yourself To build your houses you guys have to take it upon yourself day in and day out Depending on how much time you guys have within every single day and how how how bad you guys Want it To see how many houses you guys can build so let's say again We take the supers we take two people who have never built a house in their entire life And we give them the same toolbox and the same blueprint and the same tools necessary to build a house and The first bad construction worker builds one house every single day Will he eventually get to that good construction worker spot? Will he eventually get there? Yes Okay, his timeline is going to be however long. Let's say let's say for him to be a good construction worker It's going to take 10 years for him to be able to perfectly make houses over and over and over again And there's always going to be room for improvement for him now Let's say we have that second construction worker and we give him the same tools the same toolbox the same blueprint The same materials But he makes five houses a day. He is going to have way more time Building houses He's going to have way more repetitions. He's going to have way more experience He's going to have way more mistakes than the person who just builds one house a day So by the time that five year period Is up the person who built five houses a day compared to the person that built one house a day Is going to be so much better But again with trading this is why it's difficult with building a house Are they leaving any of their tools out? Are they going to be going to be going to be going to be a good building house? Are they going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be a good building house? Are they leaving any of their tools out? Are they going to be going to be going to be going to be a good building house? Are they leaving any of their tools out? Are they going to be going to be going to be going to be a good building house? Are they leaving any of their tools out? Are they going to be going to be going to be going to be a good building house? That third construction worker He is the same tools. He is the same blueprints. He is the same materials as those other two guys And he makes 10 houses a day But he leaves out pieces of the blueprints every single time he builds a house Every single time he builds a house he builds it differently in the wrong way and he doesn't apply and doesn't use all the tools necessary By the end of that five year period That guy will be in a worse position than the person who built One house every single day for five years consistently doing it the right way He will also be so much farther behind the person who built five houses a day Correctly for five years straight So how can we apply this to trade it? A lot of you guys who literally know everything necessary in order to turn profitable are not profitable And why is that the case? Because you're not doing this right now Because you're not doing this right now Because you're not doing this right now Because you're not doing this right now You're not doing this right now You're not doing this right now You're not doing this right now You're not doing this right now You're not doing this right now You're not doing this right now You're not doing this right now You're not doing this right now You're not doing this right now You're not doing this right now You're not doing this right now You're not doing this right now You're not doing this right now You're not doing this right now Every single month That's what you guys are doing with your trading strategy You guys are implementing a new strategy Every single month and you're pretty much putting yourselves back to square one That person if he gets a new blueprint And new toolboxes and new materials Every single month He will be nowhere near Again Where that person who did five houses The perfect the right way consistently For five years He won't be near them He won't be near the person who built one house consistently Correctly for five years straight And he'll probably be on that equal level Of the person who skipped out on steps in the blueprint And somebody who didn't use the tools necessary So we have to understand how we're acting within the market We have to act with discipline And we have to act with consistency And those are probably two of the biggest lessons And those are probably two of the biggest lessons And those are probably two of the hardest things to learn And those are probably two of the biggest lessons And those are probably two of the biggest lessons And those are probably two of the hardest things to learn And those are probably two of the biggest lessons And those are probably two of the biggest lessons And those are probably two of the biggest lessons And those are probably two of the biggest lessons And those are probably two of the biggest lessons And those are probably two of the biggest lessons And those are probably two of the biggest lessons And those are probably two of the biggest lessons And those are probably two of the biggest lessons And those are probably two of the biggest lessons And those are probably two of the biggest lessons And those are probably two of the biggest lessons And those are probably two of the biggest lessons And those are probably two of the biggest lessons And those are probably two of the biggest lessons He's really good at that one simple thing He's really good at other simple things He's really good at dribbling the ball He's really good at dribbling the ball He's really good at dribbling the ball He's really good at dribbling the ball He's really good at dribbling the ball He's really good at dribbling the ball He's really good at dribbling the ball He's really good at dribbling the ball He's really good at dribbling the ball He's really good at dribbling the ball He's really good at dribbling the ball He's really good at dribbling the ball What I want to do with this What I want to do with this What I want to do with this What I want to do with this What I want to do with this What I want to do with this What I want to do with this What I want to do with this What I want to do with this What I want to do with this What I want to do with this What I want to do with this What I want to do with this What I want to do with this What I want to do with this What I want to do with this What I want to do with this What I want to do with this What I want to do with this What I want to do with this What I want to do with this What I want to do with this What I want to do with this What I want to do with this What I want to do with this What I want to do with this What I want to do with this What I want to do with this So for me, if I'm really good So for me, if I'm really good So for me, if I'm really good So for me, if I'm really good So for me, if I'm really good So for me, if I'm really good So for me, if I'm really good So for me, if I'm really good So for me, if I'm really good So for me, if I'm really good So for me, if I'm really good So for me, if I'm really good So for me, if I'm really good So for me, if I'm really good I'm going to give you guys concepts And I'm going to give you guys tools In order to become a profitable trader But you guys are going to be good Or better at certain tools Than everybody else Okay, there are some things that are going to click in your head That makes sense to you You have to use what makes sense to you Because if it doesn't make sense to you And if it doesn't work for you Don't use it at all Because it's not helping you And maybe you do want to get good at it Because you know it's a fundamental and you know it's necessary to be a really good trader. But what a candlestick is Like the open and the closed That's a really basic thing If we can understand that We have to understand that to be good at trading And maybe it takes longer for you to understand that So what are you going to do? You're going to drill it in silence And I know I was just talking about that With a beginner concept But we need to think about that With our strategy And with how we take trades Because if I introduce order blocks And I'm not going to be trading a thousand winning trades on it Every single day day in and day out And you're like I want to be like Jeremy Or I want to be like TJR Who's trading this certain way But you don't understand how it works Or it doesn't make sense to you You won't be a good trader And instead if you're really good at entering off of fair value gaps Or spotting a liquidity suite And that's what works for you It wouldn't make sense for you guys to try And only enter off of order blocks If you guys know liquidity is your forte You guys have to do what's best for you And what makes sense for you And what's your best app And then if you want to add something new to the mix Don't add it in live trading scenarios Add it in back testing Add it in private Until you get so good at it Where it's literally so overwhelmingly obvious That you need to add it to your arsenal To your toolbox And then you'll have another tool that you're really good with And then that's what will make you a good trader So I'm going to end this video here And hopefully that changed your perspective on trading And maybe you guys are a five year long trader And this is what's the missing piece for you And you guys can be done off of this Because a lot of you guys So many of you guys You guys have already gone through my bootcamp You guys have already you guys already understand the fundamentals of trading And I'm going to start with the fundamentals I'm going to start explaining candlesticks A lot of you guys already understand that A lot of you guys are pros with the fundamentals And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And I'm going to start explaining candlesticks And for whatever reason I've gotten really good at problem solving I had this seventh grade teacher in computer science And we had a problem solving checklist And it was pretty much So he didn't have to answer dumbass questions What the checklist was was like Literally just go down all of this checklist Before you even ask him a question It's like check all plugs and connections Check if the wifi is good Restart it Do this, turn the power off, turn the power back on Unplug it, plug it back in And then like it was just this this like seven step list That was a problem solving list And more often than not You would go through that list And you would never have to ask him a question ever Obviously there's more problems to solve than just like Oh the computer's not working And like computer science class and seven grade But it's pretty similar Where it's like if you guys can really work on your problem solving skills Then you'll be able to solve problems But anyways, my mastermind student asked me a question Said hey, what are good psychology books And I said This is a good psychology book I wrote it myself And I opened up a text box and wrote it down And it goes like this Learn a strategy Perfect, I'm going to teach you a strategy Don't ever change it Don't change it Don't change it, I'm going to strangle you if you change it Go back to the construction worker example Literally, I don't know how many times I'm going to have to do this Literally, I don't know how many times I'm going to have to yell at you For you guys not to change it Because you guys are going to change it every other day Because you're like Yeah, training's not working Yeah, cuz you fucking just learned it Understand that good things take time You're not going to get rich quick from this Ever, ever in your entire life And if you think that's how it is Guess what? You're going to die unhappy Because your life's going to suck dick Okay Good things take time Learn a strategy Don't fucking change it Do it forever Trade it forever Until you get good at it Manage your risk Meaning, you know, make it so you can live to trade another day Don't be a dumbass That can be applied to all of you And you can do it And you can do it Don't be a dumbass That can be applied to all of you Don't over-trade Don't over-leverage Probably one of the biggest ones here Circling back to never changing your strategy Don't have multiple mentors I was in my mastermind class Again today explaining order blocks How I marked them out How I trade order blocks Order blocks work for me These people they pay me a certain amount of money To teach them how I trade And somebody goes in there Listen to me Teacher Y'all This guy on YouTube marked I'm-you-who Is he me? No You literally paid me money To teach you how I trade And you're saying this person I don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck Because guess what? The second you say wow-vick You're fucking-you screwed up, bro You're already changing shit Make it as simple as possible Have one single mentor If your mentor is a good trader And knows how to trade And has a good strategy that works for them That makes them profitable Guess what? If you use that strategy If it makes sense for you If it works for you and you continue to trade at it And you get good at it Then it'll work for you too It's awesome how that shit works But the second you guys start over-complicating it And say well Teacher Well, teaching our trades Marks out order blocks You guys are so annoying You guys over-complicate trading for no reason, bro You guys are just over-thinkers and under-doers Wow, that was a fucking awesome quote You guys are over-thinkers and under-doers You guys think way too fucking much And don't do shit ever In your entire life, bro So stop saying like T.J.R. You mark out order block-butt like this But this one guy on Twitter who has 1,000 followers Said he doesn't like this and it works for him Then guess what? If it works for him and you want to trade like him, bet Go do it with him But the second you start fucking flipping shit The second you start marking out order blocks Like that person does And then you're trying to use my strategy Where I'm out-mark out order blocks differently And oh wait, now you're trying to pull in Support and resistance Throw that shit into T.J.R. strategy And I don't even use that shit either And then you say oh no, I'm gonna throw on some Bollinger bands Next thing you know, you don't have a strategy that fucking works Stop having multiple mentors, have one single mentor Have one single person that you learn trading from Whether that's me, whether that's anybody I don't care Choose one singular person and learn from them It's going to confuse you guys way too much It's going to cause you guys to hit pop from strategies It's going to cause you guys to get information overload And start thinking Well price came down bounce off of support But wait, T.J.R. said this is a fair value gap But wait, I see T.J. said this is a Oh, pd array But wait, there's a like, shut up bro Like, shut up Your brain is going fucking berserk Tell it to shut up Because if you look at how I present trading I literally, it's like a step by step playbook It's like this happens, then this happens Then this happens, and you press buy or sell And you take your hands, you shove them into your ass And you don't do anything until stop loss or take profits get hit And oh, would you look at that The next chapter in T.J.R. is trading psychology book is don't overthink I didn't even read that far Don't overthink You guys sit down This is what you guys do bro And for all beginners watching this Remember this video because this is going to be you guys When I start introducing concepts Don't do what I'm about to do And it will benefit you so much Well, on the weekly timeframe we got a breaker structure Oh wait, um, okay, so this is an order block right here And then we tapped into this But then if we go into the daily We're in an trend right here And then there's a fair value gap right here So we're bullish right here But bearish right here And then the equilibrium It came in here And then we had a higher, higher, higher low But then we broke structure right here So I thought we should have gone down And then we broke structure again And then we actually went down But then we liquidity sweeped And then broke structure again And then more Ready? This is what I want to do What I want you guys to do Just like if you guys can do me a favor If you guys are actually passionate about trading And if you guys want to learn from me If my concepts make sense to you If the way that I trade makes sense to you If you guys just like me as a mentor Because I can teach shit simply to you guys Stop overthinking And just forget everything that you ever ever ever ever ever ever in your entire life Learned about trading and you know what's crazy I went into the mastermind the very first lesson I was like yo literally take everything that you've learned from trading Besides the basics like what a candlestick is and what a nut trend is And what a high or what a low is And throw it out the window And it's crazy because when we were talking about shit that you would think is like a basic ass thing Like literally what a high and low is Like that guys my mastermind My mastermind's hardest subject to understand Was how to identify highs and lows in the market bro And this is as simple as I put it all I'm going to teach you guys the same exact way that I taught them Not like this is just a shortened version of it Because for them it took a full hour to get this A high is a two candlestick pattern A move up then a move down A green candle then a red candle A loke is a two candlestick pattern A move down then a move up A red candle then a green candle That's it that's it that's it that's it You would think that it would have ended there There were questions for about 30 minutes Let me try and find the example that somebody used This was it Again I know if you're new here if you're just getting into trading trust me this will be beneficial for you I know you don't quite understand what I'm talking about right now but like trust me We have to just throw out the garbage We have to stop overthinking because if we can stop overthinking and just take it for what the information is And stop thinking this is some fucking hard-ass impossible weird that you have to wrap your brain around like It turns out it's pretty easy This is what they said I remember what did I say a high consists of a move up and a move down it's a two candlestick pattern Two candles what did the two candles have to be green then red for a high The guy said well what about this is this the high right here Why isn't this the high Do you see a down candle following it? It literally took like 10 plus minutes to explain that this is the high And the awesome thing is is like if he was able if we were able to like identify that Money would have been made on this day I made money on this day It's shit like that where it's like you guys are just over complicating this for no reason For no reason at all stop over complicating it The last line on the book I know I just deleted it or it might be still be on here I deleted it but the last chapter in the book was just execute My psychology can be broken down like this Do what you're supposed to do and don't do what you're supposed what you're not supposed to do Again it's literally as easy as that What are you not supposed to do in trading You're not supposed to over trade you're not supposed to over leverage and if you're doing either of those You have an issue bigger than trading You just have a life issue in general That means that if you tried to stop any of your bad habits right now in life you wouldn't be able to Which means you have no hope in trading whatsoever ever in your entire life Like ever if you can't if it's so if it's literally that hard for you Where if you truly want to become a full-time day trader It should be so easy to just be like don't over trade don't over leverage and execute on the strategy Just let time do its thing and you will get good It literally could be I could end the trading transformation here And you guys could use grab a strategy from the internet and get going get started with it The problem is some of you guys just must not want this shit enough Because if you wanted it enough you would know exactly what you're supposed to do and you would do it So then it comes an issue of like what are you even doing this for? Are you doing this just like are you doing this because it's you put in your head that trading is a get rich quick scheme Because trading is not a get rich quick scheme Anybody that says it is is a fucking idiot Because get rich quick schemes there's no such thing as a get rich quick scheme Unless somebody comes to you which I'm not doing and says this will change you can make like $100,000 from this in a month And you believing it and then you trying to do it and lose all your money doing it That's what a get rich quick scheme is I am telling you guys right now that trading is a skill and it's not a get rich quick type of thing And I told you before it's going to take a long time to get good at this skill So if you truly want it bad enough you will literally start today doing the shit that you are supposed to and stop doing the shit that you're not doing Stop doing the shit that you're not supposed to and it really shouldn't take more than that For it like it shouldn't take more from me than that Because if you're unable to do that you don't want to be a trader like simple as that or you don't want it bad enough Because if you wanted it bad enough you would have been doing the shit that you were supposed to do and you wouldn't be doing the shit that you're not supposed to It's as simple as that and some people genuinely just don't want it bad enough So I'm glad that I made this video today this can be kind of like our filter of who wants to be good at trading And the question that I'll leave you guys with this with this video hold on Chuck Judg The question that I want to leave you guys with is why do you want to trade? Do you want to trade for the money that you see on the internet that comes from trading? Or do you want to trade because you genuinely enjoy being able to come into the markets day in and day out and predict where price wants to go? If you said the first answer Thank you for coming to my trading transformation take everything that you apply and apply it to another business that you genuinely enjoy And I just saved you thousands of dollars on courses on live accounts on funded accounts on discords which you guys shouldn't be joining anyway On signals which are useless I saved you a bunch of money you're welcome Because if you sit down on the chart and if you look at the chart in the morning and think I cannot wait to make money today you are doing something wrong Versus if you come into trading and you sit down and you're genuinely excited because you cannot wait to be able to predict where price wants to go Or you just love being able to beat I'm like look bro I'm a fucking narcissist I'm a hot head I'm stubborn I love being right And you know what the best thing is being right in a market where everybody else is wrong And that's why I love trading Literally today or the other day I talked about this Bitcoin chart Everybody on crypto in crypto Twitter was bearish within this air I said no I expected dick size candles within the next one to three weeks Said that I've that green line Boom that is what makes me happy And my bank account my crypto wallet is just part of that Because you guys can only imagine the money that I made from that move But that's not what makes me happy again is not I love being right I love it It's the best feeling in the world to me fucking love being right and I love helping people Let that kind of sit with you for a bit before you guys go on to actually start learning concepts Because if you start learning concepts and you're like this is boring I don't like this this is lame Choose a different business The best business that you can be in is a business that you can work on forever And what can you work on forever something that you love because work won't feel like work it'll feel like fun When I was learning trading and when I am trading I'm genuinely having fun When I'm making these YouTube videos teaching you guys I'm genuinely having fun I'm enjoying myself it's awesome I love it And I can work I can do this forever I can literally it's crazy bro I can do this shit forever forever bro I love it it's awesome Like that's what you guys don't understand I love this I love this I love teaching I love teaching people about this it's like two passions in one It's awesome I got a Kimbo passions bro And some of you guys trading just not your passion and just get lost bro you're welcome I saved you a bunch of money and I swear I saw some people are going to get through this and be like Can't I know what he's talking about I don't make a million dollars and then like months from now You guys are going to be thinking back to this video and being like damn I should have listened to you to that one new TJ Air Trades Because the only way you're going to be really good at something and make a ton of money from something Is if you love doing it bro swear that's the only that's the only way the only way that you're going to make Ridiculous amounts of money money that you can't even imagine money money where it's just like everywhere Is not by pursuing money itself it's by pursuing your passion because How do you make money you work and if you love your work You'll be able to work forever and you'll be able to make insane amounts of money So sit with that drop in the comments if you guys Genuinely like are like me and you just love being right love being able to predict where price wants to go Day in and day out if that's you awesome were nerds were nerds together bro love it if that's not you Dip out no hard feelings I'm glad that I could help you A Kimbo passions anyways, I appreciate you guys. I'll catch you guys in the next one. Peace out I wish there was like a way for us to touch lips after these Sucks focus. Okay, so what I want to talk to you guys about today I want to talk about how Trading can be really easy if you just simplify it and I know it talked about that a little bit in the videos at very beginning of this whole thing But I'm just going to continuously hammer home The mindset that you have to be in when you get into trading and the things that you have to be doing when you're getting into trading And the things that you should not be doing okay because again successful people it's not necessarily What they do that makes them successful. It's what they don't do that makes them successful because I've even seen it within my mastermind Where I grill them for like the first week whole everything psychology just rewire their brain And they were like boom we got it and I was super hyped I was like awesome y'all are gonna kill it And then I start laying out the tools I say like look here's candlesticks, you know like they already know candlesticks But you know like here's break of structure here's liquidity here's fair value gaps here's order blocks and after all that I start seeing in the chat and it's like they're doing everything that they're not supposed to be doing They're taking too many trades a day they're over risking they're overlapped like they're just fucking up And I'm just sitting there like Bro what did we even talk about for the first week then it's almost like I need to do a psychology mastermind Where it's just like a full month where if you like already know a strategy that works for you like let me just Grill you for a full month until you get that shit through your head. This is how easy trade it can be don't overthink Don't over complicate and Let's lay out what we shouldn't be doing and what we should be doing Okay, so I'm kind of going to put you guys onto the charts here And we're just going to make a little text box Okay, talk this one out Let's see So we're gonna make a little box talking about what we should not be doing Okay, and this is going to apply to life and this is going to apply to trading and if you can't apply it to your life You'll never be able to apply it to trading because that's just how the shit works if you're undisciplined in one area You're going to be undisciplined in every other area So just how life works if you fold in one area you're going like you're going to fold all over again Okay, so I want you guys to kind of do this along with me Or write this down with me. I'll give you guys time to pull out your notebooks pull out a pen and paper and You guys should be doing this Honestly like every single day until you get it through your head and until your subconscious is like just knows exactly what to do Literally just write this shit out every single day Okay, so number one even though we haven't got there yet Or first of all, let's just talk about what this is So your trading mindset shift can't type at all today This is going to be your trading mindset shift okay, and What we have to know and what we have to understand about Changing how we trade Is we have to do pretty much everything that you guys are not we have to stop doing everything that you guys are currently doing right now Okay, so if we think about it, what are you guys currently doing right now that's causing you guys to be unsuccessful within the market Let's just write out what unprofitable traders do in the first place We'll set this to the side Unprofitable Okay, so let's start off on this one several strategies a lot of you guys Oops a lot of you guys are trading Multiple different strategies every single day you'll take one trade with TJR strategy the next trade You'll watch a YouTube video on mom of effects is five minute strategy. You'll take that one the next trade You'll take a Lambo Rao wool strategy you guys have like 20 different strategies that you're trying to work at All together And you're never going to be successful doing that in trading, you know why you're stretching yourself then It's like say hey, I'm going to try this one this one this one this one this one this one this one this one this one this one all at the same time And you're going to suck at all of them all at the same time and you'll never get better at all of them at the same time Because you're trying to do them all at the same time So if you want to get good at the skill or get good at a strategy you have to have one single one So unprofitable mindset number one a lot of you guys have several different strategies along with that A lot of you guys have several mentors choose one you have to choose one a Lot of you guys watch my videos a lot of you guys watch ICT videos a lot of you guys watch, you know other people's videos I Don't care who you watch even if this means you guys stop watching me all I want is for you guys to turn into profitable traders I'm fine with you just saying look TJR I fuck with you, but this guy's strategy works better for me awesome. We'll tap up. I did my job I did what I needed to do you can step out here and And then boom, okay? Just have one mentor because again with several strategies. I teach certain confluences a different way Your other mentors have different strategies your other mentors Sorry, oh, Boogie your other mentors Trade differently than me and they teach things differently than me If you guys want to be successful in trading you need one single mentor and you need one single strategy Because it's the same thing you're stretching yourself too thin If you learn trading from me you learn trading from Raouu you learn for it trading from ICT you learn trading from somebody else Again, it's like input one input two input three input four and all of them are just little trickles instead of just one boom full power faucet So have one strategy have one mentor moving forward You guys overthinking you guys over a complicate trading way too much bro way too much You guys get into trading and think you need to be able to solve the fucking like The cure for cancer in order to be able to be successful in trading. It's not the case Simple simplicity is better within trading Guess what I taught my mentorship students Okay, and I'm going to keep bringing them up because these people are going to be killers after this shit And I taught them I said look I'm going to give you guys a strategy you won't be able to take a trade every day You probably won't be able to find a trade every single day But I guarantee you if you stick to these rules 100% of the time Stay disciplined don't over risk And obviously don't over trade because you're sticking to the strategy You will be profitable straight out of this It Because I gave it to them so simply it's literally step one step two understand what you're looking for step three step four execute And it's like the eat like I gave them literally one It's just a checklist and then it's execute hands off And I guarantee you they will be profitable if they follow that checklist The problem with a lot of you guys with Trading Is you guys are looking at 20 different timeframes You guys are looking at 30 different confluences You guys are looking having 10 different strategies in your head And you have three different mentors giving you their daily bias for the day We need to stop that My mentorship students they're only looking at four timeframes And it's three confluences Of those four timeframes It's as easy as that You don't need to be looking at some bull like Bro trust me right now another basketball analogy for you guys When you guys are looking into these advanced ass concepts which is one of the reasons why I'm not necessarily a huge fan of like These people who are teaching like 30 year plus complicated ass concepts to people who are just trying to get into trading today You're one giving them the opportunity to over trade And two giving them the opportunity to over complicate the buck and overthink everything If you guys just keep it simple and just say like look I understand that right now my strategy is simple But I know I'll be successful with it Just do that right if you just learn how to play basketball and you know for a fact You'll make that layup every single time wide open layup That's the only shot that you know you can hit that you know you're successful with And then the coach puts you in the game and then you try and hit a behind the back 360 reverse layup You're obviously going to miss you're obviously going to be unsuccessful versus If you have that open layup and you just shoot the ball you're probably going to make it You have a much higher probability of making it with a simple shot compared to just As like a two-month in basketball player You guys have to think about it like that you guys are like literally several months into trading Like barely even into this shit And you guys are trying to do shit that People who have been in the market for 30 plus years are not going to name any names But there's somebody in In here on on youtube That is doing this to you guys And he's teaching you guys shit That he understands because he has 30 plus years in the market But you guys have no fucking clue what he's talking about And you guys think you know what he's talking about It's like LeBron being like you know Peep this super advanced fucking basketball move And you're like two months into Trading Or two months into basketball And you barely know how to dribble with your right and your left hand You're never going to be able to make that shot Ever Until time catches up with it You know once you have time That's okay you'll be able to get there But for now let's focus on the easy shit And trust me with the easy shit will be successful So let's make it easy first And be successful with the easy shit So stop overthinking and stop over complicating Keep it Y'all know the saying kiss keep it simple stupid K-I-S-S keep it simple Stupid Okay That's what I need you guys to do So you guys have several different strategies Several mentors And you guys overthink and over complicate You know what else you guys do You try and get rich quick You need to understand that this is a skill And this is going to take a long time to be successful in And it's going to take a long time to get rich in it Right now you guys have super low starting capital Okay, funded accounts can help with that But you also don't know how to trade yet So one you should not be trading on a live account right now Okay Why would a coach If a coach sees hey man You're two months into playing basketball You've never played in a game before We don't know if you're going to be good matter fat Come join the NBA you're going to be starting That's pretty much what you guys are doing By jumping into a live account and putting like $5,000 on the line You're going to get eaten alive by this market You have no experience You have no clue what you're doing yet Pro get on demo and get some reps in first Play in games that don't fucking matter Before you go into the fucking playoffs and in the NBA championship This is not a get rich quick scheme You guys make it up in your head that it's a get rich quick scheme You guys think you're going to get rich quick by doing this It's not the case you will never get rich quick doing something I will tell you if you follow all my rules all of my steps that I'm going to give you guys throughout the straight and transformation You will be able to make money quicker than other professions Where you have to clock in, clock out, climb up the corporate ladder But you guys have to understand it's not going to happen in a month You're not going to make 100k a month in a single year You probably won't even make 100k in a single year after like two or three years of trading But again eventually you will be able to get to that point It's just not as quick as you dream it up to be Okay Moving forward what else you guys do Let me think what else do horrible traders do You guys have a bunch of different strategies You have a bunch of different mentors You guys overthink everything and you overcomplicate everything You really do think you have to be fucking eyeing sign to solve this shit You really don't It's literally like literally if you guys keep it as simple as possible Bro you'll be able to be profitable you won't be able to take a trade every day But that doesn't matter Right if the shot's not there and you you only know that you're going to be successful on that simple as shot Just don't take it. It's as simple as that Just know your time is coming Okay, might as well just take the successful shot so we can get better right now You guys think you're going to get rich quick it's not the case What else do you guys do You Moving on from the give rich quick you guys give up way too quick Because when you don't get rich quick You give up and you move on to the next Giver rich quick scheme What you guys put in your head that's going to get you guys rich rich quick you guys think it's going to be drop shipping You guys think it's going to be Amazon FBA You guys think it's going to be You You guys think it's going to be a bunch of this shit All of those it's the same process Same shit you got to work hard for a long time get good at the simple shit then advance to the advanced shit And then a boom eventually you'll get there over the course of a long-ass time So you guys get into trading And you're like oh I can't wait to make a bunch of money You have all these different strategies you try try try try try try for like one day on each of the strategy On each of the strategies You fail consistently And then after two months you say I didn't make a hundred K. I'm out of here If that's your mindset Get the fuck lost you'll never make money ever in your entire life swear You'll make money but not the way that you want you'll never make a lot of money All you guys have probably the shortest attention span ever in the entire world Wow You guys have short attention spans You guys think this one little plug-ins going to change your life and it's not You guys need to think long-term and we talked about this in these earlier videos Where if you guys can think long-term five years down the line I know that sounds like a long time but think about how old you are right now Five years isn't that far down the line compared to how much more life you have to live after that Right if you're under 20 and you're watching this video Bro You are even if you're above 20 25 30 everything after that you have the skill that is life changing now We need to understand that Skills are life changing And we also have to understand that skills Take a long time to learn And we have to have that long-term vision And like it won't probably won't even be five years It'll probably be a little bit less than that But you guys have to kick that little fucking short dopamine fucking short attention span to occur, bro You got to kick that shit out Because if you don't You're you're not going to make it in entrepreneurship in business and trading Because in order to be successful in these you have to have a long-term vision So kick your short attention span to the curve whether that means you take away tick-tock whether that means you take away social media Whatever it may be You guys need to take it away and then last but not least What the hell You You guys over learn What i'm going to teach you guys in this trading transformation bit series We're going to start you guys off at the very beginning a lot of you guys are going to be ditches Remember I want you guys to throw away everything that you think you know about trading Before coming into here Okay, a lot of you guys are going to learn shit and then be like Immediately jump ahead, bro, and i'm i'm gonna fucking knock you out, bro It drives me fucking nuts I teach you guys a concept and then instantly it's like boom let me apply this with some shit that I learned from somebody else and my other strategy Happened in my mentorship literally the other day I teach them the step-by-step Four-time frame strategy on how they can be successful And we get into the call and i'm like all right everyone share the trades that they took we're gonna go over them I'm gonna cheat them this and that People are taking trades off of one minute liquidity sweeps often like bro We weren't even supposed to go on the one-minute time frame people were talking about I went on the weekly bro Did you not even fucking listen Keep it fucking simple There's there's a point of diminishing returns with overlearning you guys try and you guys try and overlearn in under practice Wow, that was hard All you guys do is overlearn it under practice, bro, and it drives me fucking nuts you guys think The the cure to your unprofitability is going to be watching another iCT or tjr youtube video Eventually you know everything that you need to know about it and you just have to get to fucking work and practice it I know youtube videos are entertaining, but guess what they're doing no fucking good for you at all In terms of your trading journey in terms of your success Okay, you you just have to get into the charts and practice what you've already learned the simple shit You guys literally get in and then you start learning like 20 different concepts and then you're like bet. I'm ready to apply all of them No, bro. Let me just give you one piece two piece three piece four piece. Okay. We apply all these We learn how to do our layups our easy shit our easy little jumpers. We get really good at those bet Again, this trading transformation transformation series. This is my entire youtube channel from here on out There's going to be more advanced stuff down the down the line Bear with me, bro. I'm trying to teach you guys the right way But first we have to learn the simple shit. We have to get insanely good at the simple shit. Then we add More concepts boom something else Boom we're in something else Boom we get really good at that something else. We just keep adding little pieces and we keep upgrading But right now you guys don't know shit. You're unprofitable admit that you're unprofitable All you guys think you're a hot shot fucking best traders in the world you guys don't make shit from the market get real with yourself Start with a simple shit you guys can't you guys literally are not profitable. You guys can't even get the simple shit done yet That says a lot about you You guys literally are not successful making a fucking layup and you guys are trying to hit a half-court shot currently Let's start on the easy shit All right, so now What does that mean for a profitable trading mindset? You have one strategy You Have one mentor again. I don't give a fuck if it's me somebody else.

It makes me want to Let me help you Have one strategy have one mentor Simplify everything Get rich in a long period of time Stay strong for a for a long time Long time frame You Long time frame Bro come on these people are fucking yelling outside give me a second Long time frame mindset Seven Overpractice Learn One step at the time Okay I need you guys have one strategy one single mentor Simplify everything make everything as simple as possible Understand that if you guys can do this you guys will get rich in a long period of time not quick You guys will genuinely make money over a long course of time Be consistent with this for a long period of time You have to have again look at look at the majority of this stuff It's all simplicity in long-term mindset It can literally be boiled down to those two things Keep it simple and understand that it's going to take a long time to be able to do this and you have to be okay with that Stay strong for a long period of time be consistent for a long period of time Think in years not days in in decades not months And over practice and learn one step at a time Don't go in and learn five different confluences and then try and apply all of them at once. You're going to suck dick at all of them Get into the market Learn step one just like how we've been doing on here. I'm giving you guys one piece at a time And then I'm giving you as homework look spot these pieces. Oh, we're good at that Boom perfect Checked off the box now we can add something else. We have to over practice and learn one step at a time Not learn five steps and then practice it once and then give up practice for weeks Get insanely good at it and then move to the next step And that is how you guys are going to be successful in trading right all the shit down reread it every fucking day Do whatever it takes This is it bro This will turn you profitable period bro like this is it Get the dribble for y'all Nah plan talk that shit talk that shit But anyways today I wanted to make a Little video um not necessarily covering any concepts because what I wanted to cover Is that trading is like building a house or like a skill okay and everybody right like I can be really good at trading for and I can be really good at Let's say identifying liquidity and somebody else can be really good at trading because they trade off of like Bollinger vans or third trade off of like indicators and that's their thing and what you guys have to understand is that this shit Isn't just going to be like a copy and paste As strategy. I'm going to give you guys a super duper systematic strategy that you guys can Really like try and apply buy your dolo and see if it works out for you Okay, but for some of you guys it just might not make it make any sense For others it might make complete sense and it might turn you profitable along with all the discipline and all the psychology stuff Okay, but when I go what I want you guys to understand from this video is that Every single trader is going to be different. So I'm going to do my best to explain how I trade And I'm going to do my best to explain concepts to you Where you guys can take those concepts and pretty much create your own strategy out of it Okay, and that's my main goal and that's what I wanted to kind of get into in today's video Even though we've kind of already covered it today's going to be short as fuck. Okay, but I need you guys to understand that like when I introduce liquidity and when I introduce strategy and when I introduce all of these concepts I need you guys to understand like I'm pretty much just laying out tools for you guys to use You don't necessarily have to use them Some of them will be more beneficial than others. I'm going to lay out these tools for you guys which are going to be Pretty much confluences. Okay, so like break-and-structure is one tool I'm going to lay out liquidity. I'm going to lay out order blocks. I'm going to lay out fair value gaps I'm going to lay out equilibrium. I'm going to lay out breaker blocks I'm gonna try and just give you guys a bit I'm going to try and lay out like a complete toolbox for you guys So that you guys are able to be like I want this one this one this one this one this one And then thing bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb you guys can work with it because it makes sense to you some of these confluences and tools You're just going to suck dick at that and they're just not going to make sense to you Cool if that makes it that's the case bet leave them alone Okay, so before I wanted to like start introducing these concepts and these things where Going over these confluences and these tools. I needed to make that clear where If it doesn't make sense to you Don't fucking use it and if the way that I teach some shit doesn't make sense to you either Rewatch it and try and make it make sense or pick a different mentor if like my strategy doesn't work for you Then like go and find somebody else's strategy that works for you Does that make sense and when I say That works for you It doesn't mean that instantly turns you profitable Okay, because there's no strategy that's going to do that Okay, turning profitable is a combination of a bunch of shit. It's a combination of you know being disciplined It's a combination of wristman experiment. It's a combination of time nobody talks about that shit Time and experience literally I saw a tweet the other day or I saw a tweet today Where somebody was like oh you want to get good at trading or you want to get good at crypto Like just start clicking random buttons and see what happens and get better from there Like it's as simple as that like experiences by far the best teacher That's what I want you guys to understand is Experiences the best teacher Some of the shit that I explained to you might not make sense and if it doesn't make sense kick it to the fucking curb Unless it's like literally necessary to trade the way that I trade and if the way that I trade doesn't make any sense to you Either make it make sense by rewatching the videos over and over and over again or Just find a different mentor Because strategies are everywhere on the internet for free. Okay. This is full like disclosure When you join like any sort of mastermind or any sort of course Including my own your mentor is not going to get in there and be like Day one the secret key of profitability that I've been keeping from you for this entire time that no Traders allowed to see or post for free on YouTube and they only keep it in their $2,000 mentorship like It just doesn't exist So if you guys join like a mastermind like my mastermind or like mentorship or somebody Course you're going to see Essentially free information that you've seen everywhere on the internet But the benefit well okay like courses be personally like the pre-recorded shit I'm not that big of a fan of because again. It's literally free information. That's everywhere on the internet I like the way that I do my shit because I'm going to explain my shit to you guys and then it's like bet Y'all can ask questions and then I can actually fix the shit that you guys are doing wrong But that's besides the point every single strategy is for free on the internet Okay, there's no little fucking hoax-pocus magic key to success So you guys just have to find one that works for you and We know that strategy Is not the the differentiating factor of turning profitable or not so like if my strategy doesn't work for you bet Choose a different one and then learn from all my psychology videos and learn from my risk management videos And if my risk management doesn't make sense to you bet Watch somebody else's video line, you know like all that I can say is the best teacher is going to be experience so And then on top of that every strategy is for free online so like don't like again the pre-recorded shit Isn't necessarily the best okay Like the shit that will really benefit you will be like active live asking questions I'm going to lay out a bunch of tools for you and if they don't make sense and if they don't mean shit to you And if they just like you try it for literally months on end and you're like I'm not profitable and I'm actually using good risk management and I'm actually using good psychology And like you just see negative progress You see here win rate go down You see your shit just go down and I don't mean like in a week And I don't mean like in two weeks. I mean like over the course of a couple months Then you can just say like bet scrap that shit because experience is the best teacher Okay, so learn from these tools that I give you I'm going to give you shit ton of tools throughout this entire thing And then you guys are going to grab them and you guys are going to try them And choose the ones that work for you and the ones that don't You Throw them away. Okay, simple is that all right. That's really all I wanted to make this video on I wanted to make sure you guys like understand that my strategy isn't the end all be all ICT strategy even though he has like a billion isn't the end all be all Your favorite mentors strategy isn't the end all be all it's not going to be the thing that turns you profitable You guys just have to use what works for you and then you guys have to get experience Doing the shit that works for you because if it makes sense to you like it makes sense why you're entering That's the best thing. That's the biggest and best thing Where if you guys fully understand why you're entering and you understand why price is moving and reacting the way that it is at that point in time of your entry Andrew exit Andrew take profit boom Now just time that's all you mean Cool, that's going to be the title of this video time time is the secret little orb Wow game changer quote time is Really what's going to turn you profitable It's like a fushigi commercial y'all remember that fushigi no way look what I literally have on my desk This is what time is in trading Fushigi Get time get experience use a strategy that makes sense to you I'm going to lay out a bunch of building blocks and if they don't make sense to you and if they don't work Cool, that's what this shit is here for to turn everybody profitable That's my goal. So like if my shit doesn't work for you Bet I'll be able to turn you profitable by taking you guys away from me and at least giving you guys the right headspace And like understanding what you're supposed to do And then take it somewhere else for somebody strategy that works for them Cool, so now that you guys know how to properly think about day trading Now that we know that this isn't some get rich quick scheme and that this is a skill that you guys are going to have to build over a long period of time And we understand that we are now going to get into the fundamentals of trading So if you guys are brand new to day trading and you guys don't even know what a candlestick is what a time frame is These next videos are going to be super useful for you guys to help actually start understanding the charts So again whenever you guys get on YouTube you're seeing these crazy charts of price moving up and price moving down And you're like what the fuck does this even have to do with trading and how do I even understand this That's what I'm going to be covering in these next videos So you guys are an absolute beginner. This is going to be super useful for you guys to understand the Japanese candlesticks Which I know sounds like weird like we have a little candlestick and we're going no that's well I mean, it's kind of like that we have a little candlestick and we're going through the dark to be able to predict where price wants to go Okay, but this is going to be the absolute base and fundamentals of how you guys are going to be able to analyze the charts moving forward And this is going to be literally the base of the pyramid that you guys are going to be establishing all of your day trading knowledge on Okay, so we need to be able to understand the base fundamentals of the charts like candlesticks like time frames Like highs like lows like uptrends like downtrends like consolidation and things such as like break of structure These things are going to be super beneficial for you guys to help build this foundation that again It's not going to necessarily teach you guys how to day trade just off-riff you guys aren't going to be at that point of time to where you're like Yes, I'm ready to predict with high probability where price wants to go off of this no But this is going to be our basic absolute fundamentals that we have to understand these things in order to Be able to build off of this to get into strategy to get into certain confluences So with that being said, let's jump right into it And I think I've done a good job of putting your guys heads in the right position So that you guys can be successful moving forward. So for everybody that is A trader we're talking about the anatomy of candlesticks. We're going to talk about just candles Why are the openings where the closes the highs and the lows of candlesticks and we're going to talk about highs and lows within the market And then we're going to talk about trends pretty basic pretty boring stuff But without further ado, let's get started So if you guys come across a chart that looks like this might as well understand what's on the chart first and foremost right? Honestly, we'll get into this first on on trading view. There's several different types of chart. There's um Candle a Japanese candlestick chart, which is usually what most people use There's a line chart And there's like hi Kenashi. There's all there's all these different types of charts The most normal one is a Japanese candlestick chart which looks like this and I have special little colors if you guys Want to see my colors. This is what they look like if you copy them it will instantly make you profitable You know, it's crazy when I first started trading. I would literally copy my mentors Chart colors because I was like His chart looks so clean like And I thought it would make me profitable um far from the truth. So I don't even know why I showed you guys that but anyways These little guys right here are called candles You know why they called candles because they look like candles We put a little flame on it. Oh look It's a candle We have the the waxy part of the candle and then we have the candle wick and Believe it or not these little tails To the downside and to the upside are called wicks because these are candles crazy So I'm going to explain the anatomy of these candles We'll draw one right here boom Bob Look at that little guy Look at that little candle and let's say this is a green candle oops Oh How do I Here we go This is a green candle Okay, an up candle or in my case a blue candle. Don't ask me why I just made it No Don't ask me why I have my candles blue and black and just think it looks cool Literally as simple as that okay Wow, this is more so in art class than it is a trading class at this point And All of these red And then we're going to color this guy in red boom This one looks a lot better than the first Picasso one that we got Okay, so we have an up candle and we have a down candle With an up candle a blue candle or a green candle for most of you guys if you guys are fresh on trading view There's four things that these candles six tell us Okay With an up candle this line right here We call this or actually wow There's lots of learning here. We might just talk about candles today not even highs and lows and trends. I think we'll save that for tomorrow So this solid filled in part of the candle is called the body Okay, so if we scroll down here, right? Everything that's blue and up It's the body Okay, everything that's green and up is the body and the body tells us two things It shows us where price opened and it showed us where price closed so With a green candle The start of the body because we know green means up the start is going to be down here And that is going to be where price opened Okay So in this candle's instance it's right here This is where price opened And then as along with that the body also tells us where price closed So up here is where price closed. You know why? I Don't know why I said you know why um But you know why I it they probably Made it where price closed because that's where the color stops And it's like boom ended there Okay, so this line right here is the candle clothes closure clothes boom So boom the candle sick has already told us two awesome things about price these candle sticks tell us a lot about price four things And the body tells us two things where price opened so the start of it and where price price closed Where the end of this closing area is You know what else these candles show us they show us the highest point that price went during that time period and we'll get to that And it also shows us the lowest point that price went during that time period And you know what you know what those are those are seen through wicks. So this guy right here Just to make this look better So this up here is the highest point that price went to Hi Hi guys boom this is the high So that means price went Was able to push up here and think of wicks like a snail trail or like a skid mark on your underwear You know something's been there before Similar with price Price opened right here Pushed all the way up to this point and then came down and closed Here okay, and did that time time frame right here You know what else these wicks show it shows the low so same as the high oops I don't know why type that Okay It shows us the lowest point that price went so price opened Who knows which came first the high or the low But price opened we pushed down leave a little snail trail Down to this low that means price got all the way down here And then pushed all the way up here And then came all the way back down here and then closed here So the highest point of this candle is right here and the lowest point of this candle is right here And then it's the same thing for a down candle Just the inverse of the open and the close because if the price moved down Then the opens right here The closes right here the highest point of that candle is still right here And the lowest point of that candle is right here. So that means price opened The time frame right here Maybe it pushed up first left of the little snail trail all the way up at this price And then push all the way down to this price at some point in time and then came right here and then closed Pretty cool Okay Now you're probably saying well how long do these candles last? Well, that's what these cool things up here dictate So if we scroll down So the candlestick chart Let's actually go on Bitcoin because Bitcoin is a 24 hour market You can see right now we are on the one hour chart And you can see within here Right price is moving the The closes moving currently right right now we're in a green candle or a blue candle currently Okay, and we're moving up and down notice how like up here was the high And notice how it leaves that little wick that snail trail that history that footprint of where price went It's to help us understand price and if you look at the the candle stick before there What happened to it where did price open Okay opened right here and within an hours worth of time Price at one point during that hour came all the way down here to 47,992 dollars And also within that hour price came all the way up to 48,147 dollars And then at the end of the hour it closed at 48,125 dollars So price opened right here on the hour And closed up here on the hour and we can see this current candlestick Or actually we let's move back and talk about this one because this is a down candle So boom this was one hour the hour Before this one. So what time is it right now? It's 617 my time Okay, so at six p.m This candle closed right here and at five p.m. This candle opened right here And at four p.m This candle Opened up here because it's a down candle right so this is where the candle opened Okay Right at four p.m. price started here think of the open as like the starting point from the hour And during that hour price came all the way up to 48,377 dollars and also during that hour price came all the way down to 48,000 7 dollars And then at the end of the hour it closed at 48,062 dollars Okay, and I don't really want to confuse you guys anymore The only thing we'll talk about some more is time frame So what I was just saying that that was an hour's worth of time. What happens if I click boom one minute Or what happens if I hit bone the five minute time frame now We're seeing the same chart right if we go back to the hourly time frame We can see oh look boom big can't like big candles right representing a lot of price movement amongst hours of time and Then if we hit the five minute we see that same price movement But in shorter clumps Right, but each candle represents five minutes of price action So now when we see boom this huge leg up We can see it in five minute candle six and when we see this leg down if we go to the hourly time frame That to us just looks like one down candle two three four five six seven down candles in a row Versus if we go on the five minute time frame we'll see oh We can see price moving up moving down moving up moving down moving up moving down all the way down to here Still showing the same price action still showing exactly where price went But now we're able to show where price went just in smaller smaller periods of time Okay So if we look at this This candle sticks about to close right we know it'll close because we can see the time right here It's going to close in four three two one boom we see That's where price is going to close we're going to wait for the next camp candle to open If it's going to happen boom the next candle opens And now it's starting to create itself So this five minute candle what did it do it opened right here because it's a down candle The open is always going to be on the top and the close is always going to be on the bottom and it's inverse for up candles this candle opened at 48,169 and during that five minute period Price was able to get all the way up to $48,178 and also during that five minute time period price was able to go down to $48,120 And then by the time that five minute period came up It ended right here at 48,147 And you're going to be trying to figure this out saying TJR Let's take a train I'm going to shoot you You're not even close to being ready yet We just have to understand Literally internal hot speaking in this one bro um We have to understand this first Because this is pretty hard to understand I've we're literally just going to keep forget highs and lows and trends I thought again man, I'm jumping way too far ahead here Okay, we're just going to focus on candles And if the one thing that you guys can take away Is that whatever time frame you're on represents the amount of time that the candle has to close Okay from the open to the close is the amount of time that that that the candle sticks on that chart represent And that if you're also able to identify The open the close the high and the low Within every single candle Then you're on a good track And I think I did a relatively good job of teaching you guys that today Let's try and drill a little bit more out we'll go to the 15 minute now These candles represent 15 minutes worth of price action So if we go in here And we'll leave two more and then I'll let you guys go for this little super pool sunday Think Okay, if we look at this up candle right here where did price open it opened right here right because it's the bottom of the shaded blue part the bottom of the up candle Okay, it opened and if you guys don't know where I'm getting the prices from it's on the right hand side right above me right there Okay, so we can see price opened at $48,422 At some point in time during those 15 minutes price came all the way down here $248,364 And also within that 15 minute period time price came all the way up here To 48,470 dollars and then at the end of that 15 minute time period price close right here ready last one This next candle price opened right here at 48,446 Dollars and some time during that 15 minute time period price was able to push up to 48,481 dollars And then also during that 15 minute time period we have a tiny little wick tiny little poke down But for the most part we just ended and closed that 15 minute time period right here F 48,374 dollars And the the last thing I want to leave you guys with Is the cool thing about this is you guys can see The the reason why these candles six are so awesome and so important and so beneficial to us Is because we can see a month's worth of price action in candles We are able to see a week's worth A price action in candles we're able to see every single days worth of price action in candles And then within those days we're able to see four hour chunks of those days in candles And within those four hours we're able to see our chunks within those four hour chunks within those days And within those hourly chunks were allowed to see 15 minutes 15 minutes worth of price action and within there were able to see five minutes with worth of price action And within there were able to see one minute every single minute worth of price action Whether price is going up just the tiniest bit or down just the tiniest bit To help us figure out where price is going And I'm just going to leave that with you guys here So You guys now understand two things Candles and the anatomy of them open close high low open close high low And timeframes one minute time frame shows how many minutes worth of price action Five minutes done fast No one minute The 15 minute time frame shows How many minutes worth of price action? What 15 minutes yeah Lesson one checked off you guys are killing it. I'll see you guys tomorrow or whenever the next video comes I get like horny making these because I love teaching people All right, he's out. All right. What's going on guys? We're as promised We are going to add on to our candlestick anatomy and we are going to talk about highs Lows and trends within the market. We're going to start off with identifying highs and lows And we're going to start off by drawing them out and we'll do the same with trends and then we'll go ahead into the actual candlestick chart So we can start outlining these Market structures, okay Within the market to help us Understand this, okay, and again, we're not trying to put anything together We're just learning anatomy of candlesticks and being able to identify some basic things that is necessary in order in order for us to be successful within the market So without further ado, let's talk about highs and lows. So highs and lows are a two Can okay, I'm not even going to try and write that but it's a two candlestick pattern and I'm not a pattern trader But what is a pattern or creates a highs to candlesticks and if you think about a high what does it need? It needs a move up And then what what else does it need for it to be considered a high because if it just keeps moving up then there's no high Okay, we need the high to be identified with a move up then a move down So it's as simple as green candlestick Followed by a red candlestick and you take the highest point of those two candles Now what's the low? It's the inverse a move down then a move up Red candle green candle and you take the lowest point of those two candlesticks. Boom. You just learned how to identify highs and lows Now believe it or not when I was teaching my mastermindness This was one of the hardest things for them to consume For them to digest because they just couldn't wrap their head around how easy and as simple as it could be Stop trying to over complicate things. Let's think back to our very beginning videos Where I said look, I'm going to make this as simple as possible to make you guys successful That's all I want to do stop trying to get in and do all this crazy shit From somebody who's been trading the market for like 30 years and teaching you guys shit that takes 30 years of experience to understand When we can keep this shit simple And and get you guys off to the right foot I'll love it if you guys just threw out everything that you've ever learned about trading and just restarted with this series Hey, a high is a move up then a move down you take the highest point of those two candles Lowes move down then a move up red candle green candle green candle red candle lowest point and highest point of those two candlesticks cool Let's go and identify it in the chart now Cool cool cool. Let's actually just go ahead and do this on I'll find a fresh chart Where Where are the highs on this within here? Okay, I see four Move up then a move down bet highest point of those two candles move up then a move down bet highest point of those two candles Move up then a move down bet highest point of those two candles Move up then a move down bet highest point of those two candles Simple now let's find lows I see two within this chart Move down then a move up lowest point of those two candles move down then a move up lowest point of those two candles And if we scroll all the way back down here move down and a move up the lowest point of those two candles We know how to identify highs and lows we are awesome at this guys good job clap it up but wait Some people might confuse in my mastermind somebody was asking well teach a r Well look it this candle goes up and then this candle's up, but then there's a move down and this was the highest point And this was the highest point right here What is the next candle it's up so I don't give a fuck about that. What's a high? It's as simple as a move up and then a move down. I don't care how anybody else teaches it You guys want to learn from me? Awesome. This is how I teach it and this is what works for me So this is how I'm going to teach it. I'm not gonna give you guys no bullshit I'm not going to look it's a move up then a move down don't get fucking confused This doesn't apply to me this does If this candles wick went all the way down here But it's still followed with a black candle I don't give a fuck I don't care At all ever This is the low move down then a move up and you find the lowest point of those candles move up then a move down back You find the highest point of those two candles Look in here move up then a move down you find the highest point of those two candles boom Move up then a move down find the highest point of those two candles Move down then a move up you find the lowest point of those two candles Simple enough Don't try and do no no whatever you're thinking right now shut up Shut up shut up bro. I don't want to hear it Stop overthinking shh like turn your brain off Green then red green red high Red beam low simple caveman bro That's all we need Awesome we know how to identify highs and lows now let's talk about how we can identify trends up Trends and down trends. That's how the market moves the market moves in three different ways up Down and sideways Okay, we want to talk about how we can identify all three of the ways the market moves In uptrend which is why we have to learn highs and lows first Consist of higher highs and higher lows So we see a high and then we see a low and then we see another high And then we see another low and we would you look at that? Oh there this high this high Oh this highs higher than this one and this low is higher than this one wow it keeps going Oh higher higher low higher higher low and that's enough trend You know why because it continues going up and it's trending Oh craziness is not insane so crazy now take a wild guess what a down trend is going to look like Lower highs and lower lows Why does this look so shitty There we go Lower highs and low lows there's a high right here there's a lower right here there's a lower high right here There's a lower lower right here there's a lower high right here there's a lower high right here lower lower lower High right here lower lower right here lower high right here Oh That's a down trend So we covered up down now let's cover sideways. What does market do when it moves sideways Bing bong bing bong bing bong bing bong bing bong Where there's no sense of direction When we're literally moving sideways we're not going up and we're not going down we're going Side to side And that's just called consolidation Okay, and these trends and these movements can be found on every single time frame Right if we go to the one minute I'll be able to find up trends and down trends if I go in consolidation If I go to the five minute I'll be able to find up trends and down trends If I go to the one hour I'll be able to find up trends and down trends if I go to the weekly I'll be able to find up trends down trends consolidation all of that So let's go ahead and do that right now And this is when it's going to get scary And my homework for you guys is to be able to identify Literally just get into the chart and just mark out high low high low high low higher higher low Be able to identify these highs and the lows and these trends and these market movements Because you're for you're able to do that. We're one step closer another skill learned Okay, so let's go into the four hour right now four hour time frame You where each candle represents four hours Worth a price movement Let's not pay attention to what price we're doing before this I'll give you guys a cheat sheet price before this was in an uptrend Okay Why well if we look at it where was price going it was going up That's another really easy way to identify an uptrend Versus we see what price is doing right now Where's price going it's that going down and if we want to scale in and see this Okay, what do we do we start? I'd just identifying the highs and lows within the market So boom, this is a high and boom this is a low move down then a move up We take the lowest point of those two candles move up then a move down. We take the highest point of those two candles Then we look closer move down then a move up Wow this low is lower than this one move up then a move down wow this high is lower than this one lower hose Lower hose All right Lower lows and lower highs We're starting a downtrend on the four hour time frame Now if we get in here And look unfortunately the past couple weeks super sloppy price action. Let's actually zoom out of it It'll be easier for us. Okay Let's just start Let's ignore this. Let's just start right here because I don't want you guys to get confused An uptrend move up then to move down boom high Move down then to move up boom low move up then to move down boom High move down then to move up Boom low move up then to move down even this classifies as a high if the candle is so minuscule that it looks like this Where you can't even identify the color within it just ignore it. I don't even want to see it Move up then to move down Like this you can see the color. I'm talking about when the candle is literally flat There was no gain and there was no loss like it opened and closed at pretty much the same exact price Okay, so we see a move up then to move down higher high We see a move down then to move up boom higher low we see a move up then we see move down boom higher high Let's ignore what price is doing right now So we just identified an uptrend Let's scale down into the 15 minute and now you'll start to see okay. Wow. There's a lot There's smaller trends within these bigger trends and again, I don't want you guys to get to get overwhelmed by this I don't want you guys to even look into it. I don't even want you guys to get confused by it Let's just focus on identifying trends Okay We have a move up then to move down and take the highest point right there We have a move down then to move up we take the lowest point right there We have a move up then to move down we have the highest point right there lower high We see price move down lower we see a move down then to move up boom lower low We see you move up then and we see you move down boom lower high We see a dodgy candle we don't give a fuck about boom we see you move down then we see you move up lower low We see a move up then to move down boom lower high This was a downtrend I don't want to get confused with You know when these trends break or when that we'll get into that later We'll talk about break of structure later. We'll talk about Structure and all of that later, but right now we just want to be able to identify these trends you guys are going to start seeing trends within trends Where on the 15 minute you see a break of structure Ah wow, we're getting way too far ahead hands off. That's it for today That's all I want just for you guys to be able to identify these trends higher highs and higher lows to be able to identify highs and lows I need to remember you guys are just starting out which is what I'm here for will keep today nice and short nice and simple highs lows Uptrends downtrends and consolidation what is it we don't necessarily have much of a direction You know, it's just kind of going sideways and the easiest way To see an uptrend or a downtrend Look at where it's going if it's going up or down On every single time frame is it moving up or is it moving down Or is it moving sideways So boom you guys just figured out how to identify trends and you just guys you guys just figured out how to identify highs and lows Awesome Drill it as many times as possible And then we'll circle back for tomorrow Okay Okay focus so today we are just going to be talking about break structure Okay, and we are going to be applying everything that we learned from highs lows and trends Wait highs lows trends So we're going to cover break of structure today and I'm not going to tell you guys how to use it as Confluence I'm not going to tell you guys I'm not going to tell you guys shit I'm just going to explain it to you guys And you guys are just going to have to live with that and understand that we're not here to learn strategy yet almost eventually Just not yet Okay So without further ado, let's jump right into the big Yes, a p500 we're not looking at that shit today We're going to be using our favorite tool The brush Okay, so Let's get started and Quickly recap what we need to know in order to in order to identify a break of structure. What's a high Up down Candle move up and a candle move down. What's a low? Down up Move down then to move up we take the lowest point of the move down and the move up That's the low we take the highest point of the move up and then the move down. That's the high cool Quickly identify it within the chart move down then to move up Lowest point of those two candles Boom Move up then to move down Highest point of those two candles boom Low high Do we Give a fuck about two consecutive blue candles or green candles in your guys case? No, do we give a fuck about two consecutive black candles or red candles in your guys case? No, we do not Okay, so this candles wick Was lower than this one we do not give a fuck because this is moved down then to move up. This would be the low Cool cool Now that we did a little recap of highs and lows let's get into Regular structure So we know that trends move in Higher highs and higher lows and lower highs wow those horrible this was good This was a good uptrend Let's start with the down trail. Come on man You would think that I've done this so many times there we go. That's good enough Kind of a steep ass downtrend if you guys ask me and I can't hit the highs when I hit the lows perfectly Wow Aim is off But anyways, we noted that an uptrend moves in higher highs and higher lows and a downtrend moves in lower highs and lower lows Okay So if we're in an uptrend Boeing Boeing Boeing Boeing Boeing Boeing Boeing Boeing What happens when price is this? boom boom And we end up making boom a lower low boom and then a lower high after an uptrend break structure and we're typically able to spot this even before the lower low and the lower high gets put in Because within an uptrend if we see a low Get closed underneath That's a break of structure and the same thing in a downtrend when we see a high closed above Break of structure Okay, you're probably thinking closed. What does that mean? It means the candle Literally closes underneath that lowest point So when we're in an uptrend we're Ident we're looking for lows for breaks of breaks of structure when we're in a downtrend we're looking at highs For breaks of structure Okay, so if we're in an uptrend And we're like wow higher high higher low higher higher low whoa Low gets closed underneath Okay, that's a break of structure Because Then this low that gets made is going to be lower than this one and in in a downtrend The reason why it's a break of structure is because this high Is going to be higher than this one what Okay, so all we want to do is be able to identify these and the way that we identify it is in an uptrend we're looking for lows and when The lowest point of those two candlesticks of the down then up move If we see a candle close underneath that not a wick Remember to think back to our candlestick anatomy If this is a down candle you read If the close so right here if it closes underneath the lowest point then it's a break of structure vice versa if this is a green candle And we get A break of structure to the upside the clooos the candle has to close meaning this Line right here on the candlestick has to be above this high Okay, so Again, this shouldn't be too difficult on her stand I just drew it out for you guys. Let's go ahead and Spot this spot them got them Okay, so if we look at this It's a great for this example Okay, what were we in if we just move this to like whoa, my things glitching We just move this here Okay, if we just look at this like let's make this as simple as possible We have a high then we have a low then we have another high then we have another low whatever consolidation Then we have another high and then boom look at the most recent low right so before this we were in an uptrend We're probably thinking why we weren't in an uptrend yes, we were why Look at price it's literally going up we have a high then we have a low Yes, this is technically a lower high and you're probably confused But again, sometimes the the market moves sideways, but again, this is a higher low Okay, so as long as long as the lows within an uptrend are not close underneath and we're not going to break structure But then what happens? Okay, we get a higher high cool, but then this candle closes right this is the Where this candle close Underneath the most recent low. So what did that do that broke structure to the downside? And then what do we see price do we come up we make a little high right here and then we continue low Okay, let's find it in the opposite direction. Okay, break structure to the upside This is perfect right here. Okay, so we see boom prices dumping down. We're in a downtrend right high low high low high low high and then what happens This is the high move up then a move down boom this candle is equal. Okay, so we didn't necessarily get a break with this candle But then boom this candlestick closed Above this high within a downtrend Where did price go after that Higher and I don't want you guys to get any ideas you guys cannot definitely will never ever ever be able to turn profitable Just by identifying break structure. So before you think that this is the golden ticket To being profitable just like Put your hands back in your ass and keep watching these videos. Okay, because you're not even a second of the way there But this is a really awesome tool that we will use Way later down the line and throughout all of our trading and that we have to understand and because we know the concepts of highs lows and trends We can now identify this and now we have this nice little tool in our toolbox Okay, so does that make sense when we're in a downtrend we're identifying highs Okay, and we're waiting for highs to get broken above and we're not necessarily waiting we're just Understanding that if a high gets closed above if the most recent high gets closed above in a downtrend that it's a break of structure Okay, and now what has started an uptrend Okay, so if we look From there right price ends up moving higher Okay Let's try to Some other examples of this okay On Nasdaq we have a move down then a move up Price closes this candle stick all the way underneath This low where does price go after that down okay, it broke structure out of this uptrend that it was in Okay, we were in an uptrend here. We get a break of structure to the downside and then Because we got that break of structure. We're now in a downtrend And then here we have a move up then a move down we take the highest point of those two boom We get a break up now we're in an uptrend. Okay, that's really all I need you guys to understand for now Okay, it's understand that when we're in a when we're in an uptrend If a log it's closed underneath if we get a candle closure underneath the most recent low Then we're now in a downtrend and if we're in a downtrend And the most recent high gets closed above Now we're in an uptrend. I don't want you guys to hold on. I have to sneeze I Don't want you guys to try and put no pieces together. I don't want you guys to do any of that I don't it's not that deep You guys know highs you guys know lows you guys know trends and now you know When we're in an uptrend and we see a candle close underneath the most recent low It's a break of structure and now we're in a downtrend and the same thing To the downside if we're in a downtrend and we Close above the most recent high if we get a candle closure above the most recent high Now we're in an uptrend Okay Plain and simple super super simple. That's all I want to teach you guys today Now that you guys understand the base fundamentals of day trading charts trends highs lows and timeframes Now we can actually get into the fun stuff and before you guys get too excited Okay, these are confluences and pieces of strategy that took a very long time for me to learn So don't get like too freaked out when we start going deep into these concepts Take your guys's time with this because someone like me again like I was saying this isn't going to happen overnight In one single day if you guys need to space this out and rewatch this video a couple times or rewind over a couple confluences That you guys may have missed out on that's okay I'm going to try my best to explain these in the most beginner-friendly way so that you guys are able to fully grasp these concepts and Understand them in the complete entirety building off of those fundamentals that you guys just learned and these are going to be Very very very very I can't stress enough the most important thing when it comes to understanding and predicting with a high probability Where price wants to go on a daily basis? So if you guys are unable to understand these confluences do not move to the next one and just say I'll get back to this later or all attempt to figure this out Like as time goes on no, we need to fully understand these confluences So if you guys need to spend more time on this please do that I tried to structure these videos so that they're very I guess you could say like beginner-friendly where we go from like absolute Bare minimum and then we scale up to these high-level skill sets So we're going to start off with don't discredit these early concepts that we're going to start talking about because we're going to jump straight into liquidity and draws on liquidity is probably the most important confluence that you guys are going to learn But again, it's one of these fundamentals that we have to learn and have to understand just like candlesticks just like timeframes Okay, just like trends just like highs and lows and just like break of structure to be able to Then transition that into draws on liquidity and then once we can understand draws on liquidity We'll go a little bit deeper into these more advanced concepts that are going to expand your guys's knowledge on how to predict price action Consistently with a high probability on a daily basis. So before you guys get into these just take a deep breath Get your note pad out. Maybe if you guys want to draw these out while we're going over these videos That's okay. That will be beneficial for you guys and again take your time with each one of these confluences If you guys want to split them up day to day that's okay And again, if you guys want to learn these concepts even more in depth I have a little link in the description where you guys can be coached and mentored by me If you guys are already like halfway through this video and you guys are like this is freaking awesome But I want to get like direct mentorship from you There's going to be linking the description if you guys want to sign up for my day trading blueprint where you guys are going to be able to get on Coaching calls with me and be able to relearn all of these confluences that I'm giving to you guys in this video Where if you guys are struggling with this you guys are going to be able to ask me and other coaches some questions on how to figure out these confluences and Structure your strategy in the right way. So if you guys are struggling with this Maybe you guys consider joining the blueprint because that's what it's there for to help you guys a little bit more on a more Personal level if something like this a massive free course isn't necessarily getting you guys to where you guys want to go So with that being said, let's jump into these confluences again take your time I try and go from like their minimum Scaling up to some high elite level Analyzation of price action. So again take your time with this with that being said Let's jump into it. That was insane. Drop a little comment below if you guys have been enjoying this today We're talking about as you guys can tell by the title liquidity liquidity liquidity liquidity liquidity liq uid wait liq uid ity liquidity spelling bee champion just kidding. I dropped out of college anyways boom okay Let wait Boom Okay, so we're going to go over Damn, this is actually smaller shit. Let me make this bigger for you guys. That's what she said for you guys balls Okay what it is Why we need it and then how we identify it that's day two so bad So let's cover what is liquidity so liquidity is just resting orders, okay oh Whoa five Damn nine we're getting higher and higher Okay, so what is it it's resting orders, okay, and this might not make a lot of sense to you guys right now Okay, but I just want you guys to understand the concept of it not where it is on the chart Not I'm Not word I'm so sweaty, bro Not where it is on the chart chart not how to identify it Just understand the concept itself and why we want to be able to identify it and then we'll get into identifying it And then also way more down the line we'll talk about how we can use it To our advantage to be able to take trades and to be able to understand where price wants to go Okay, so what is it it's literally just resting orders, okay, whether that be buy orders whether that be sell orders Whether that be buy limits whether that be sell limits whether that be stop losses whether that be take profits resting orders and It is on every time frame and And And it is required for the market to move slash change direction Okay, so it's resting orders and it lies on every single time frame you can find liquidity on every single time frame And you guys will understand that more when we get into identifying it because believe it or not you guys already know How to find it because it's one of the we're going too far because it's one of the concepts. Oh don't go too far Yeah, it's one of the concepts that I already taught you guys and it's super easy to identify believe it or not It appears on every single time frame and it's required for the market to move slash change direction slash break structure slash Started new trend slash continue a trend all of that good stuff because again We need resting orders to be able to fill orders to be able to make the market move right if you can't fill orders Then the market can't move okay, and that's also why we need it, okay Again, this is going to be a pretty quick video. Okay, so why do we need it? Why do we even want to know where liquidity is where liquidity lies or why do we even want to understand it in the first place because It determines where Market is drawn towards and it is required Or market to move slash change direction whoa Okay So why do we even want to be able to identify it in the first place? Because it determines where the market is going to draw towards liquidity is used as like a magnet just like a Fuck well, how can I relate this like have you guys ever seen the movie robots? And that big annoying ass like bowling ball One robot who's mean who's like the like the biggest and like the like most goaded robot And then there's like that massive swinging magnet thing and he ends up getting sucked up to it You guys probably don't remember that but It's in the chop shop y'all remember the chop shop if you guys having seen your homework tonight Is watching the movie robots. It's an old-ass cartoon movie, but it's awesome But anyways, why do we need it because it determines where the market is drawn towards? So obviously what are what is our goal when we're trying to trade Right think back to some of our beginning days what are our main goals? So figure out where price wants to go that's our only goal when we're trading It's to figure out and be able to accurately predict where price wants to go So that's a pretty big fucking thing If this thing determines where the market is going to draw towards this should be the center of our attention This should be the the fucking thing Okay, that gives that we give all of our attention because it's where market gets drawn towards and It's required for the market to even move or change direction So it's what causes price To go to another price causes price to move It also causes price to change direction it causes all of the market movements. Okay, so That is why we need it in order to determine damn In order to determine where price wants to go. Okay, because again that is our main focus All right, and if we did in our front goal is just to make money within trading We're going to suck ass at predicting where price wants to go because if our only goal is to make money within trading We're going over leverage. We're going to over trade and we're not going to enter for any good reason versus if we just want to Understand where price wants to go and if we just want to predict where price wants to go And we take accurate sound probable decisions off of that money will just come along with those decisions so Today's going to be really quick Super simple liquidity. What is it? It's just resting orders and it's on every single time frame It's required for the market to move and to change direction Why do we need it? Why do we want to be able to spot it? Identify it on the chart, which we're going to get into next video Because it determines where the market is drawn towards or it determines where the market is drawn to where prices drawn towards And it's required for the market to move and to change direction. So pretty freaking big deal this little concept right here. So That lap wraps up our first little lesson. Fuck it. We actually might split this into three um Ah, I'll see I'll see how what I want to do here, but anyways that wraps it up super quick super simple boom We have the concept don't try and look up no extra video again guys Trust me daddy Trust me. I promise you guys I'm going to make trading so fucking easy for you guys Just go one step at a time with me Okay, and maybe you guys are watching this five years from now and like you're like bet onto the next video Wrap it up fucking my chipmunk fucking Pipsqueak, okay But for the people that are watching this in real time that are like trying to learn that are like Please, please, just give us a strategy shut the fuck up. We're going to get there You guys have to understand the shit first because if you don't understand the shit first You're just going to be forever stuck in the constant cycle of bicep go bicep go bicep go Oh, I want to make money. I want to make money. I don't need to give a fuck where price wants to go Okay, and then I'm going to scream and punch all of you guys in the face when I meet you And we don't want that It'll be fun for me But we do not want that and I want you guys to turn into profitable traders So it takes one little it's a bit since once one percent better every single day In fact, if you guys are watching this five years later It's probably better if you guys take the shit one step at a time too and just like don't fucking Like just get through like the next 50 videos and a single night and then just all just try and trade it all at once It's going to be way too much information versus if you just take this once up at a time trust me It'll be super beneficial. Today we were going to be talking about Identifying it or where it lies where liquidity lies on the chart um and no, we're not going to be talking about liquidity sweeps where We are just going to be talking about liquidity in general, okay, and you're probably thinking what that doesn't make any sense Like what I want to trade liquidity sweeps. That's all you trade that's every single trade recap. You're talking about liquidity sweep I know little Billy, but guess what you need a way to fucking second because you don't even know anything right now We're on day 11 of you learning how to trade so With that being said we're just today is going to be another relatively short day all of these concepts are going to be relatively short days until we put that bitch together But that's going to be a long day that's going to be like an hour I'll probably split that bitch into like 3-1 hour segments to put that shit together for you guys, but right now like the concepts themselves They shouldn't be easy because they are pretty easy to understand and that's my goal to make this shit Really easy to understand for you guys. So without further ado, let's jump into the chart work And start talking about where liquidity lies. So if we think back to I'm not even gonna pull out the Google Doc, but if we think back to What liquidity is right? It's resting orders or air a price range where orders can get filled Okay, and we think about why we need it is because that's where orders get filled and that's in liquidity is what moves the market It's what causes the market to change direction. It's what literally makes the market move on every single time frame So there's liquidity on the one minute. There's liquidity on the five minute 15 one hour weekly daily monthly There's liquidity throughout all of that and there's constant Fills of these price ranges where liquidity lies filling of these resting orders to make the market move the way that it does So with that knowledge we want to figure out where do these orders lie where Could potential resting orders beat? Well, let's think about this in just a super-based manner. Okay, we're in an uptrend Okay, and We think about just how a trend moves. Okay, higher highs and higher lows, right? Most beginner traders or retail traders That like they're taught luckily you guys are being taught by me but they're taught that like when you see an uptrend You wait for a high To get push pass and then you enter into a long Okay, so we know that okay, there's going to be people entering into buys when highs get pushed above Okay, what else is happening? Well in a downtrend And Most people put their stop losses above highs Right, so thankfully There's a lot of fucking idiots who think uptrends are also downtrends You know Like luckily that was one of the first things that we tie you guys so you guys don't get confused with that But in turn those idiots Maybe that maybe they see a downtrend on a smaller time frame Maybe we're on the hourly time frame and they're on the five minute and they see a downtrend whatever But because of that there's also stop losses above these highs So people are pressing by when these highs get pushed above and also People are getting forced out of their cell positions that they were in Because of their stop losses above these highs and if we think about how a stock exchange works When we're shorting a stock in order to exit We have to buy those shares back at either a higher price or a lower price most of the time we're trying to get a lower price because we're shorting Okay So when these people are shorting the market and they get stopped out what do they have to do They have to buy those shares back. So now there's two sets of resting orders of people buying Okay, we have people who are getting stopped out From their short positions and we're also getting people going just clearly long After these highs get broken above So now we see damn Lots of orders get filled above highs Hmm, that's not pretty nifty Okay, now let's think about a downtrend let's think about lows Well, when let's do a reverse when we're in an uptrend And we are going long where do we usually put our stop loss underneath lows And again, there's idiots So sometimes we're in downtrends And people try and long these little retracements And they have their stop loss underneath these lows So what happens when that stop loss gets hit They have to Sell their shares back At a lower price right they probably went long somewhere within here and then boom their stop loss gets hit They exit the position at a lower price price causing them To have to Short right it's it's it's it's an exchange or sell Right they entered into buys they have to sell it back at a lower price losing money And then at the same time in a downtrend When people or retail traders see lows get pushed below Again downtrend what do they do they enter into shorts so wow We can see that highs And lows are typically Where a lot of orders are filled above highs and below lows So bingo there you go we figured out where liquidity is it resides above highs and below lows now something to keep in mind though Because we're talking about the banks or the institutions the algorithm whatever to fill these massive amounts of orders Okay, because we're talking about that We don't fucking know where they're going to fill those orders We just know That there's a possibility For them to enter into those orders above highs and below lows So it's just a probability thing Okay, so when we see an uptrend we're not like seeing a high and instantly being like short it right because then we would be stupid because then Then price would look like this And it would like be like the worst endless cycle of like liquidity sweep like just have constantly expanding Like that right and that's not how it works right because we we see price move in trends Higher highs and higher lows so we know that okay there there was potential for orders Cell orders to be filled here because there's so many people going long right If we understand that there's resting by orders here Again, this market is in exchange There are resting by orders here a shit ton of them right because there's people going short They're going to get stopped out and there's also people going long when this high gets pushed above Wouldn't that be the perfect opportunity for the market To fill It's sell orders right because we're playing against the house the house always wins The house is built to beat us So how does the house beat us by going by literally going the fuck against us There's they see oh there's a shit ton of by orders resting above highs So when this high gets pushed above What does that give them the the opportunity to do? short it They can fill their massive amounts of cell orders And cause a change of direction Cause those break of structures that you guys see or I where identifying on the chart and start a downtrend But does that mean they're they're going to short at every single high does that mean they're still filling cell orders at every single high and does that mean they're filling by orders at every single low No But we know there's just some sort of probability that it could happen Okay, so I want to go into the chart and I don't want to get too ahead of ourselves But I just want to go into And we can see this pretty frequently Within pretty much like Every freaking time frame Okay, if you if you really try and really want to do that Okay, so like again, I don't want to get too into this But we see an uptrend here right moving higher highs higher lows right there's a high right here low right here High right here low right here and then look at this candle What does it do or if we even go into the lower timeframe we can see Wow What does this look like By orders getting filled underneath these lows what is this Big Dick of a candle thrusting to the thrusting to the downside Underneath these lows do It gives The market opportunity to fill by orders why because people have to sell People have to People get stopped out of their by orders. Let's say they press buy right here They're like oh, yeah, it's forming an uptrend on the five minute. We don't give fuck Okay, people press buy right here and their stop losses underneath these lows So what does the market do? I mean give me those No more by orders for you you have to sell and you have to sell For us to buy and then also what does that do I'm sure a lot of you guys if you guys saw this big black candle stick breaking this support zone Y'all are pressing fucking sell y'all are like oh my god It's gonna go down because it broke the support Idiot markets going long But again if we zoom out because I again, I don't want to get ahead of ourselves If we zoom out on the hourly timeframe We can see that we were in an uptrend Okay Okay Let's find more examples of this we can even find it on the weekly timeframe Look at this we're in a downtrend right we see a break of structure right here. We see a high right here boom and like this is how manipulative the market gets Okay, this was like all time highs Okay, before we had like our mini freaking recession during like the started in 21 all the way till like 22 23 um Okay, we see a break of structure on the weekly and then we see oh this nice little high is made right here And then oh my gosh the markets were we just made a monthly retrace work we we can't wait To get our economy back psych Year my liquidity Because what was every single dumbass doing when they saw these highs get pushed above They were going long And what did all the people who thought they were smart asses by shorting This leg down who have their stop losses above here what were they forced to do when this goes above there therefore To buy back Those shares at a higher price Causing them to get stopped out right because that's how the exchange works They have to buy back those shares so there's two Forms of buyers here people who are getting stopped out and then also idiots who are going long and also idiots who are going short on this And then what does that give the market the opportunity to do Fill cell orders and shit the bed Okay I don't know how political we can get on gear um we all remember what happened around January February in 2020 that big spooky thing So scary If we look at the monthly time frame let's really think about how manipulative um The people in charge the market makers are Wow Ain't that convenient Ain't ain't this thing right here that little Scary thing that made us lock our doors forever And made people lose jobs and Made people lose loved ones Isn't that fucking convenient That it comes down sweeps Monthly lows and fills a bunch of buy orders and stops out a bunch of people who were going long throughout all of this and also Caused every person to be so fucking scared That they ended up shorting the stock market And Wasn't that just the best buying opportunity for the market makers and for all the people in charge Like if that doesn't show why liquidity is important Like like two months and we know that shit lasted longer than two months They just needed to hit a little pump and dump on your headpiece So they could capitalize and push price all the way up To all time rights So now hopefully you guys realize why this shit is important Because You can see through lies With the chart There's a reason why I mean I'm not even gonna get fucking political with the shits But there's a reason why I never entertained any of this shit because I saw this And I saw through the bullshit And That's all something about charts Charts do not lie ever And we can see through that By seeing liquidity So all that I want you guys to take away from that today is liquidity lies Above highs Right because what happens is a bunch of people goes go long Do we want to go long when there's like a potential sweep Well, no because the market's looking to go short or has the potential to go short And then same thing in a downtrend Okay, we know that there's a bunch of people who are going to go short Why because their stop losses underneath lows for people who have to set who have to sell their shares at a lower price And there's also people who are going to go short because They it's in a downtrend And do we want to be a part of the fucking crowd No sir We want to be Part of the fucking market makers we want to be On the winning side of things So do we press buy every time we see a low get pushed underneath hell no y'all aren't even there to learning Even how to confirm that this shit's a sweep but we just need to be able to identify It just understand boom you guys understand it liquidity lies above highs and below lows That's where the majority of orders are going to get filled Cool, and that's where prices typically drawn towards It's drawn towards highs and it's drawn towards lows Cool, I Awesome Nice we are going to be talking about order Cox order blocks and order Cox okay, so similar to Liquid to D I'm going to be talking Or just tight My brain is fried Okay, we're going to be talking about order blocks All right, just type in shit out and Day one or part one is just going to be explaining them Understanding how they work, understanding how they're useful for us So again today's going to be rather quick And then I will do part two of this and we can talk about where to identify them And keep it simple as that I want to do this a little bit differently than I did the bootcamp The main goal is to introduce all of these topics so like what I did with the bootcamp was like liquidity sweeps break of structure Let's see how we can use those two together to determine where price goes We're not going to do that what we're going to do is we're going to lay out each tool in front of you guys Not tell you how to use it yet Because I'm sure a lot of you guys have already tried to use the shit And if you have it's like What do I even waste my time and my hours doing if I'm never going to turn anybody profitable But For the people that do listen this will be fucking awesome. So The goal is just to lay the tools out in front of you before we put them into action And then once you have good understanding of the tools and why we want to use them And how to use them and how to identify them Then we can start building our first house. Okay, so First things first order blocks what even are they? Okay Let's say price range Where Large orders were able to be filled Okay, and let's think back to Well, it's not even think about that actually Okay, it's a price range where large orders were able to be filled. Okay, so If we think order block Boom perfect representation a block price to price Of range price range Where a lot of orders were able to be filled And cause the market To Change direction Boom Okay, it's a price range where large orders were able to be filled and caused Price or market to change direction break structure All that good stuff Okay, boom that's what it is simple simple enough. Okay, why We want Use it slash Why do we want to use it slash How does It benefit us Is the order cock in the room with us Is the order cock Are you seeing it in your dreams? Or is it actually real TJR? Well, I don't know I see it every morning Where where Do you see the order cock Where is the order cock Well See it every morning Anyways, why do we want to use it how does it benefit us? Okay, well, let's think about what it is It's a price range where large orders were able to be filled and caused market market to change direction So why would we want to use this or let's reverse this how does it benefit us? Let's talk about that first Well, we know for a fact if If Large amount of orders So So So So So So So So So So So So So So Okay, so Sorry, I just had to go add the mode on that But why do how does it benefit us and why do we want to or why do we want to know how to use it? Okay, if a large amount of orders were able to get filled within that price range Right, we see it get made we see the order block get created Okay, if price revisits that area It's more than likely that because there were so many orders that were able to get filled before It's likely that there will be Availability for us to fill even more orders in the same direction So we know that price will likely if we see a rejection right if price comes up to that price range And then we see like buying power out of it or like selling power out of it whatever Type of order block it is bearish or bullish Right up or down If we see a rejection off of it Will likely know that hey Price was able to fill even more of those orders because that's a high quality Price range where a bunch of orders were filled beforehand to change the market direction In the first place So when we revisit that area and then we see Right, so if we have Ah, I don't even want to give this away, but Okay We have our order block right we see that this Is where the orders were filled that caused price change direction I don't even want to get into this because this will be tomorrow, but If we come in and revisit this and then we see More selling power come out of that We see rejection out of that It's pretty safe to assume that even more orders were filled within here The price is going to continue lower and go in the same direction As those orders that were filled previous Cool Cool And there we go that is order cox, okay order cox explain order blocks explained All right, all right, so welcome to order blocks part two So anyways if you guys remember from yesterday we talked about What they are and why they're useful to us How we can benefit from them how why we need them Okay, so we'll do a quick overview of it. What are they? Okay, it's a price range right order block Okay, it's a price range where a large amount of orders are able to get filled that change price direction or cause market to move Okay, so with that in mind Oh, I'm sorry and why do we want to know where to identify them within the chart? Well, it's safe to say that if This is our little price range is a horrible box if this is our little price range Where large orders were able to get filled before causing price to move or change direction Safe to assume that if price revisits this price range and sees Selling power out of it if it's a bearish order block Then price is going to continue in that direction and then similarly If price revisits a bullish order block and we see buying pressure out of it It's pretty safe to assume That more by orders were able to get filled Within here and prices going to continue to the upside so With that knowledge now let's figure out how to spot them within a chart and again We're not going over how to take trades off of them. We are just going over how to identify them Okay, so Where do order blocks appear order blocks appear? Where do large orders get filled large orders get filled where liquidity lies? Oh, we're combining tools. We're actually going to combine two tools liquidity sweeps and order blocks or liquidity sweeps and break of structure to be able to find order blocks today So we're using our tools now, okay? If we know that large orders right if we think about liquidity and Change of direction within the market We know that large orders could potentially be filled above highs and below lows We also Can know that those large orders are are filled by seeing price push above highs And then seeing a break of structure After pushing above those highs changing market direction So Then what does that make this this leg up that causes that liquidity sweep that causes those orders to be filled what is this price range? Ding ding ding it's in order block. Okay, so the leg up That sweeps liquidity That causes the break of structure to the downside that causes all those sell orders to be able to get filled Is our order block and when we see it revisited and then selling power out of it It's safe to assume that price can move further to the downside now same thing In the other direction when we see lows get swept And how do we know they're swept when we see a break of structure And then what does it and what does that make This price range In order block because a bunch of buy orders were able to get filled on this sweep To the downside and then from there We see price come down Revisit that area and if we see buying power out of it it's safe to assume that price is going to continue higher Okay, so all order blocks are When it's a bullish order block. It's the leg down that causes the liquidity sweep the move down Just the move down. Okay, we're gonna get into this and I'm going to fucking yell at you because a lot of people are Superfreaking stupid and it makes me want to scream. It's just the leg down. It's not any of the move up. It's just the leg down That causes the sweep And how do we know it's a sweep when we see the break of structure Same thing to the upside Okay, it's the leg up No, it's not it's not this move down. It's the leg up That causes the sweep how do we know it was a sweep because it breaks structure right after that Okay, and it's the price range From the leg up Cool Let's go into the chart and start identifying those Okay, let's look at this We see on the weekly timeframe perfect example we see price move up sweep these highs When it was in an uptrend Then what happened Price breaks structure changes its trend to the downside by closing underneath that low Then what does that make this the leg up? From here up to here That is the order block why because it's the only the move up we don't count the fucking move down. It's only the move up Okay, the move up That causes the sweep how do we know it's a sweep because we break these lows and change Market structure that we already learned about and then what does price do we revisit the area? We see selling pressure out of it price continues lower. Okay, let's see another example right here. It's another example Okay We see a low Within a downtrend right how do we know it's a downtrend because we broke structure right here. We're moving down Okay, move down then to move up we find the lowest point of those two lows Okay, we see a leg down And then we see a break of structure how do we know it's a break of structure because this is the high move up then to move down We close above it What happens the price that revisits the leg down The move down not the move up we don't include the move up just the move down that caused the sweep Where those orders were filled what does price do it revisits we see buying pressure out price continue tire And this can be seen on every single time frame along with every single other tool that I give you guys During this trading transformation every single one of these tools can be found on every single one of these time frames Another cool thing. Okay, we saw this get filled into this order block But we made another one. How do we know that? Okay, we have a high right here move up then to move down Okay, we see price push above that We also saw price. Okay, move up then to move down This is a high we broke structure to the upside right On this So we were in a mini uptrend for the time being on the weekly But then what happens we come up we sweep these highs how do we know it's about sweep because We end up breaking structure with this candle Where's the move up that caused the sweep it's from this low all the way up to this high It's the whole move up what do we see price revisits it we see selling pressure out of it price moves lower craziness Look at this on the monthly timeframe We were in a downtrend how do we know we were in a downtrend because move down then to move up cool This is a low we got a break of structure awesome. We were in a downtrend We see a low We see him move down Then When do we finally see a break of structure right here with this candle sick we see a break of structure to the upside Where was the move down That caused this sweep from here down to here What does price do it breaks structure it revisits that area Revisits the order block we see buying pressure out of it price continues higher Um, let's try and find some more examples right here More examples we were in a in a downtrend right here Okay, we see boom Uh, I don't really like this example because the the sweep is on an up candle I take that back. I don't want to use that example. That was actually that weekly example that we used Oh, yeah, this one's hilarious I Look at this remember when I was talking about this one on liquidity sweeps The conspiracy theory the little scary sickness Yeah, this one this one was hilarious look what it made What do we do We come down we sweep out these lows Sweep out all these lows when we see a break of structure back to the upside right here Where's the move down that caused the sweep right here We see the break to the upside right here. We see price revisit. We see buying power out of it price continues higher So freaking funny See if I can find any on the lower timeframes Cutter partner to spot on the lower time frame because there's so many highs and lows The bit harder to track Okay, this one's a decent one. All right. We had lows over here Or We could even just say this low Right here, okay We see the leg down that caused the sweep boom We see the break Of these highs with this candle We see the look the move down that caused the sweep We see price revisit it we see buying pressure out of it Price continues high This was one We see we were in an uptrend We see these highs pushed above Then we see boom break structure to the downside See the low right here we see the break where is the move up That caused the sweep we see price Barely poke a tad on in there Move down price continues lower Okay, I think I've shown enough examples for us to understand this Okay, the easiest thing that you guys can do is just draw this out right Boom boom boom boom. This is our order block boom boom boom boom Right, this is the sweep. Okay, this right here is our order block Got it Cool Should have been pretty smooth With that being said I think we covered order blocks if you guys need help Covering it again rewatch this video rewatch any of the other videos that I have on it And let's keep moving okay good job. All right guys welcome to another little video So today we are going to be talking about fair value gaps and per usual We are going to introduce these guys first by talking about what they are and why they're beneficial to us So without further ado Fair value gaps slash imbalances Okay, you guys will hear me talk about Both of these it's pretty much the same shit. I'd I really there's no reason for me to Use any different name for them. That's literally just How that shit goes I end up just saying the names Like interchangeably so whenever you hear fair value gap whenever you hear imbalance. It's pretty much the same shit Okay, so first of all what are they okay? So the reason why I like to say imbalances is because it's an imbalance of market borders. Okay, and I Okay, that's kind of as simple as I could put it so It's an imbalance of market orders and it's a price range that lacks orders in the opposite direction of market sentiment so when we go into Identifying them it'll be a lot more obvious where you guys will see what I'm talking about But for the time being just try and understand this. Okay, it's an imbalance of market orders meaning There's a lot more buy orders or there's a lot more sell orders than buy orders There's a lot more buy orders than sell orders And it's a price range again that lacks orders in the opposite direction of the market sentiment So again, if we see just like a huge influx in price and we make an imbalance that price range typically lacks orders right so if we see a bunch of buy orders And we see an imbalance get formed that price range will typically lack a lot of sell orders Okay, and same thing if we see a big rip down Okay If we see a big rip down that price range and we make an imbalance that price range typically lacks buy orders Okay, so why is this beneficial This is going to be quickly Why is this beneficial to us? Well First of all if we know Well Let me just write it out first Damn I Why is this beneficial to us if price revisits that price range so again, let's say we see a big rip up And we see an imbalance get formed and we know that that imbalance is lacking sell orders And we see price revisit that price range where there's a huge imbalance where there's a lack of sell orders within there And we see price revisit that area And we see buying power out of that range with the same market sentiment right so If market ripped up we see an imbalance we revisit that and then we see buying power out right that's the same sentiment with overall market bias or market direction We can assume that more buy orders were filled within there and price will be able to continue in the direction that it was going Because more buy orders were filled within that imbalance where a lack of sell orders were Make sense And that's all it is That's why it's beneficial to us and this helps us predict Where the market wants to continue to go and you guys will see a lot more information on that when we Talk about identifying them Okay, but for now we just need to understand it Okay, for value gaps Whoa are an imbalance of market orders And it's a price range that lacks orders in the opposite direction Of market sentiment and why is that beneficial to us because when or if price revisits that price range with the lack of orders And then we see buying power or selling power out of that range With the same market sentiment right like either that rip up or that rip down We can assume that more orders were filled and price will continue in that direction that price is going So this is like a continuation confluence Okay, and we'll see when we put everything together How this can benefit us Okay, this is a super super useful tool Okay, now different than liquidity Right, and this is something I should have mentioned about order blocks as well liquidity can be used as a draw as like a magnet for where price wants to go to right because it's seeking to fill orders versus this and order blocks are continuation confluences Meaning when we seek liquidity and we fill orders Right, we're constantly seeking those highs and lows within the market to keep filling orders to keep the market moving versus these are just continuation confluences Meaning they don't necessarily have to get hit to keep market going in the direction Right, that's why I said if price revisits that price range And we see buying and selling power out of it Right, because it's just the possibility Most of the time does it happen? Yeah, but sometimes it won't happen Okay, this is just extra extra confluence that price is going to continue in the direction that it was going in the first place And I'll explain more on that When we get into identifying these things Okay, but for the time being This is what I want you guys to understand It's an imbalance of market orders It's either lacking by orders or lacking cell orders Depending on what direction that big move up or down was Okay, and if price revisits that price range where we saw the lack of buyer cell orders And we see buying power or selling power out of that range You know depending on what the market sentiment was We can assume more orders were filled and price will continue in the direction that it was going Cool continuation confluence order block is also a continuation confluence um Something I forgot to mention we'll go ahead and cover that super quick right now. So same thing right we know that Boom this leg up is the order block does price have to just is price needing to come back up Up in here in this price range to fill those orders know But if it does and if we see selling power out of that We can assume that more cell orders were filled and price is going to continue in the direction to the downside It's the same thing with imbalances and fair value gaps Okay, same things to the downside or sorry to the upside we see the sweep this is the order block right this leg down Do we have to revisit This price range no price could just move higher and higher and higher If that look would have been sweep was all it needed But if price revisits this area and if we see buying or selling power or in this case buying power out of it We can assume that price is going to continue higher Cool Cool, okay, so that being said fair value gaps day one heart one locked in strapped up Good to go all right fair value gaps and imbalances so we talked about what they are we talked about why they're useful for us Okay, now let's get into identifying them. Okay, so what I want you guys to understand is a imbalance and a fair value gap can be identified by three candlesticks. That's how we identify it. It's a three candlestick pattern Okay, we're gonna draw it out and then we're going to go into identifying them Jeez that was horrible and then we're going to go into identifying them on the chart Okay So I'm going to Van Gogh these little drawings for you guys right now We're going to jump right in so A imbalance is a three candlestick pattern Okay, so there's three candles and the easiest way to identify it is Usually it's a big-ass move to the upside or a big-ass move to the downside. Okay Does that always qualify to be an imbalance? No not necessarily sometimes there can be an itsy bitty price range that an imbalance is within Okay, but typically we can see it like the easiest By seeing that there's a big-ass move right because when when we think back to How we identify them or what they even are there's an imbalance there's a lack of either buy or sell orders Okay, which is what causes that big-ass move to the upside or that big-ass move to the downside because there's no orders going in the opposite direction of where price wants to go Right, so and again price revisits that area then it can do good things for us and it can help us Figure out where price wants to go. So with that being said let's talk about identifying it and then we'll get more into that so boom Three candlestick pattern we have our first candle, okay We have our second candle. This is the candle that pretty much creates the imbalance and then we have our third candle Okay, how do we identify where an imbalance is? Okay a A bullish fair value gap or a bullish imbalance We mark it up. We mark it out. We mark it out With the top of the first candle's wick Okay, and the bottom of the third candle's wick. This is a bullish imbalance Why is that? Well, if we look at these three candles we can see okay, this candle stick Oh one wick up, but then boom selling pressure down. So we know that there's sell orders within here Right, we know that sell orders price got up here and sell orders push price back down And then the next candle boom big rip through here Okay, price stops right up here sell orders push it down we close then we see this candle get formed We see sell orders pushed down till here, but then buy orders buy it back up What does this mean? This means that there were no sell orders within this price range Right, because we don't see any wicks going into this if we did Right if this candle stick if this candle six wick went up here Then we would know that there were there there were resting sell orders that were able One when price pushed up to be able to push price back down and close right here Same thing with this candle if this candle's wick was even lower Then we would know that okay price had sell orders to push all the way back down here Okay, so when we identify this We need to look where the wicks are not and we need to see that that move through it Okay, where there's just empty space. It's literally a gap fair value gap Okay, within here there are no sell orders Now Let's talk about in the other direction Okay, I wish I could just flip this upside down. We'll do another band go for you guys a bearish imbalance Oh, huge leg down You A bearish imbalance we identify it From the first candles bottom wick to the third candles top wick Okay, and it's just the opposite way around okay, so within this price range We know that there are no buy orders right because we see sell orders push it down and then right here There were buy orders that were able to push price back up here, which is what made us this wick Right, because this is where price has been Okay, then we see boom big rip down we see it flood through this price because there's no resting buy orders to cause any hesitation through this area next candle opens We see price push up But there's no buy orders if there were then price probably would have kept pushing But there's since there's no buy orders within this price range We got till here stopped and went back down Cool Makes sense Now again, how is this beneficial to us Let's think back to yesterday if price revisits this area And then we see buying power out of it We Can safely assume that price is going to continue in In that direction higher Right because we see oh there's a lack of sell orders within here and then when price gets back Into this price range and then we see buying orders or buying power get out of it What can we assume we can assume that more buy orders were filled within here and since there's a lack of sell orders Price is going to move higher Same thing over here when we see price revisit a bearish fair value gap And we see sell orders And where we see selling power coming out of it we know that there's a lack of resting buy orders within here And we can see that okay, they're selling power coming out so we know sell orders were filled What does that mean price will likely continue down In the same direction that it was going Okay Let's talk about what a fair value gap is not Because we could have a huge candlestick Like this But if this candle's wick is up here and this candle's wick is down here Do we have a gap? Do we have an imbalance? No Right it would be from this candle's top wick to this candle's down wick And oh wait that like our our box would be inverted What what it would be inverted there's nothing there's no box to be made on that there's no gap Okay, so if that's the case there's nothing to even mark out Same thing over here if we see this candlesticks wick go down here and this candle six wick go up here Oh Oh There's no box to draw because these wicks overlap Okay, we need that gap in that lack of sell or buy orders All right now let's go into identifying it on the chart And then I honestly think we'll just leave you guys with that for now Okay So again, this is one of those things where there's going to be a lot of these on the chart Right if we just look within here Boom for value gap here Oh for value gap here Boom for value gap right here Boom for value gap right here right we could go on forever Do these always have to get filled no because if that were the case and price would just be that like going nowhere But are they useful For if price wants to revisit that price range and we say see selling or buying power out of it Is that a pretty decent confluence? Yes a hundred percent Okay, so with that in mind let's Go ahead and try and identify some of these and Show it working out. Oh, this is a decent one. Okay, so again I don't even want you guys to be trying to put shit together like oh liquid to these weak breaker for sure for value gap shut the fuck up Okay, let's not get into that right now Let's just get into what we're focusing on and that's identifying for value gaps. Okay, so where's a fair value gap? This is a bearish for value gap and again Because the reason why like if you guys use this and you're just like I'm just gonna spot a random fair value gap everywhere And take a trade off that you are going to be the worst trader of all time if you're only taking trades off just fair value gaps Getting pushed into and then like buying or selling power out of it again This is a continuation confluence. Let's wait until we have our entire toolbox to start taking full-on trades Okay, but we see boom huge dick down Okay massive black candle Bearish imbalance why we see this candle six week we see this candle six week. There's a gap Mark it out from the low to the high. What do we see price do we see price push in there and then we see price boom Push right back out selling power out of it price continues lower Let's look right here. Okay, we see it bullish fair value gap From this week up to this week Okay, you're probably saying oh this week went down. Well, yeah, obviously it filled the freaking fair value gap Listen Okay, we see price revisit it Are you paying attention? Didn't think so lock the fucking Okay We take it from this week. We take it from the top wake of the first candle to the bottom wake of the third candle If pre-but if If If price wants to revisit this area Which it did and we get buying power out of it cool We can assume that price is going to move higher what did price do it revisited it Revisited Got buying power out of it with this bullish close and I'll talk about how we can identify Like more of like buying power after this, but boom we see this bullish close price continues higher Okay Let's find more examples. They're literally all over the place right here Okay, we see boom huge candle right that's like the easiest way to talk about them We actually have to right here. Okay, this just goes to show that not every single fair value gap is going to get filled You know relate that to life however you want not every fair value gap is going to get filled You won't be able to fill every fair value yet But you got to take your shots when you're When you're open bullish fair value gap bullish fair value gap price pushes in We see bullish confirmation out of it or buying power out of it. Okay price continues higher Same thing right here, right? This is all I want you guys to do just be fucking quick scoping These freaking fair value gaps, okay bullish fair value gap right here. Oh, what's this bullish fair value gap? How do I know there's not a freaking wick covering the shit up? Okay? You know what's not a fair value gap just all of these like pubic hair looking wicks everywhere we don't This is nothing that this is nothing that we're teaching today This is See these big ass gaps Okay This is a bearish for a value gap from this way down to here From this wig Down to here you're probably saying well T.J. R. I got filled and then we side go down Cuz I know some of you guys are saying that shit right now What did we say we're just trying to identify them Not learning how to take a trade because right now Uh, this shit like if you guys just tried to take a trade of fair value gaps You would lose billions Every single day you would lose all of your money ever Okay, so let's lock in Again, right why didn't it work shut up It's going to work later Just listen right now please Please I ask please listen right now, okay? Do you guys get the gist? You guys get this Okay Bolish fair value gap three candle pattern You take it from the top of the first candles wick to the bottom of the third candles wick And if the wicks overlap, it's not even a thing Bearish fair value gap you take the bottom wick of the first candle To the top wick of the third candle and if the wicks overlap there's nothing to see Cool, that's all we need to know all we need to know is how to identify the shit We got it. It's a cool box I have I have show and tell Okay, go make a bunch of cool boxes and go show your mom and dad and Clap it up for yourself. You learned another tool All right today we're going to be going over imbalances and how Invalidations of them can either one invalidate a trade idea or two validate a new trade idea Which is kind of like my take on a inverse fair value gap I don't really believe in inverse fair value gaps But I do believe in a fair value gap getting Invalidated as a confluence. So today's going to be pretty simple You guys already know about fair value gaps. Today we're going to be talking about invalidation of fair value gaps How that can invalidate a trade simply by a fair value gap Literally just getting invalidated by a closure underneath it or a closer above closure above it And then we can also talk about how invalidations of fair value gaps can be used to raise up baby ground Okay, let me lock in um Okay, this is a good one right here again. This isn't necessarily our execution time frame, but This is a good example of it Right here. We get a sweep of liquidity. We get a break of structure Okay, and then we have a fair value gap right here Okay, so this can do one of a couple things We see this break of structure right here right and then we see the fair value gap get formed So imagine we're on like the 15 minute or the five minute and we're like okay bet. This is where we want to enter obviously If we get a closure above this, okay, maybe there's other confluences, okay, like we have this breaker right here Okay, yes, it gets respected off of this Okay, and yes, we have this order block and yes, it gets respected off of this as well, but then boom it gets invalidated afterwards But we also invalidate this fair value gap, okay so I mean, it's literally as simple as like it just closes above it So that's that's the first way right just purely invalidation of a fair value gap boom Right here, okay But let's say so that's that's in the downside direction now Let's say that our bias was bullish on this, okay, so boom there's invalidation one where it's just like purely the Fair value gap gets invalidated and we're no longer going to take a trade off of it That's the one use of it where we literally just get a closure of above it and then it's like okay scrap that fair value gap It's not working for us Okay, and then the second use is where we can potentially use it for a confluence for entry Okay, so And again, I'm not that big of a fan of like inverse fair value gap where you have to wait for it to come back down and then like get it tapped into I'm more of a fan of it just like a bearish for value gap getting invalidated when our biases bullish and we close above it invalidating that bearish for a value gap. So let's say That our bias was bullish and we see Fuck it. Let's see like we sweep out these hourly lows We sweep out these hourly lows and let's say like we already have a bunch of confluence as we break structure And there's a bearish for value gap right here. Imagine we already broke hourly structure within year Let's say there there's like a break of structure right here, okay And we're looking for confluence is we can use an invalidation of a bearish fair value gap Um as a bullish confluence, okay, so let's say we already have our break of structure and then boom We get a closure above here that can be a reason for entry. So again, let's say we already have our break of structure This can be a reason for entry and we can even put our stops underneath That bearish that old bearish for value gap because again, it could be used for a inverse fair value gap even though I'm like in my eyes and inverse or value gap is a pretty made up concept. It's like broad like You can see that this fair value gap gets invalidated and then what happens another fair value gap to get formed oh But That's besides the point we can use this invalidation of The old bearish fair value gap as a confluence to one either enter or as just like a confluence for A potential trade setup so just like how we have Regular fair value gap just like we have breaker blocks just like how we have order blocks just like how we have Equilibrium this is another confluence that we can use to either enter into a trade or to set up a trade So in this standpoint, let's say that we're actually looking for a trade We can say that um Okay, this is another good example. Okay, look Let's say we were bullish we see a sweep of this and then let's say we're like actually looking for a trade setup Okay, we get a break of hourly structure and let's say we're just dumbasses and we don't see this Regular as fair value gap and we're like oh, we have this bearish fair value fair value gap right here And let's say we don't see this break of structure. Okay, all of this is just hypothetical And we see a closure above this bearish fair value gap Okay Showing that this bearish fair value gap is now invalidated that can be a reason to go long on this candle Put your stops underneath the old bearish fair value gap and then boom price continues higher Okay, um, let's find another example of this And again, obviously we need but it can't just be like oh bear bearish Fair value gap gets to sell like this is a perfect example of when this shit wouldn't work because look Okay, we get a break of structure to the downside Right here damn shut the fuck up Can y'all not tell I'm making a fucking YouTube video I Come on guys pipe down Anyways, but look like we can tell that this is an obvious bearish setup right we see a sweep of liquidity We see a break of structure. We see an order block right here. We see a breaker block right here And we see price push into that order block push into that breaker block just because we invalidate this bearish fair value gap Doesn't mean like holy shit. We're gonna go bullish right because this is an obvious bearish setup So again, just like all of our other confluences It's not like oh see order block take trade or see fair value gap take trade right that's not going to work We need all of our other confluences to be in line with it like a sweep of liquidity a break of structure all of that Right, so this is an example where that shit wouldn't fly that shit wouldn't work because again we're still in a downtrend And we pushed into just another one of our confluences. We're still with an equilibrium all of that Okay, so let's just keep drilling this shit out and show other examples of where this shit would work um Let's get down to business. I need to take up this so bad I gotta take a peepee I Really not much going on. Let's go over here. I gotta pee so bad, bro Boys, I literally might pause this video and then go take this or am I just taking you guys with me? um oh Okay, so this is an example of where like We get kind of two and one okay, so we see a sweep of these lows Okay, and we kind of get two confluences in one like I was saying we got a sweep of these lows We get a break of structure to the upside and In turn with that break of structure to the upside we invalidate this bearish fair value gap and at the same time We make a bullish fair value gap Both end up getting filled so and this order block ends up getting filled and then as we can see boom price ends up moving higher Okay um This can be another example here where we get a sweep out of these lows Okay, we get a break of structure right here invalidation of this fair value gap um, and then we end up taking out these highs right here Okay, so boom we get a break of structure to the upside on this candle You know, maybe you find some bullshit within here, but Okay, we invalidate this fair value gap. We end up seeking out This liquidity right here and this liquidity right here man. I gotta take this We Boys, I'm literally in a swimsuit. I might as well just go pee right now I've double cuts Be normal. I got pee Damn, hold on to chop a city in this bitch Hmm Here let me go into like a market open. I wonder if today's market open. I heard that since it's since I'm in Hawaii Fuck did I remove all the drawings? Damn it Here, let's go to yes. I heard that today's market open was pretty shitty because I was watching more trades take-off Um Just kidding but seriously. Okay, so It's going to the hourly. Okay, there really wasn't fucking shit today, but let's just okay Oh here look Okay, so today we sweep out again. Is this a trade that I'll take probably not um, but whatever. It's a good example Today we get a sweep out of these lows. Okay And we have a bearish for value gap right here. We see price boom close above that shit We can scale down even further see we get a closure above we come back down Retest that inverse fair value gap, but in turn there's a bunch of other confluences here Okay, like we just have um A regular ass like smaller bullish for value gap from this week to this week Um, you could have used equilibrium. I'm pretty sure equilibrium got hit I'm literally about to paint my pants boys Yeah, so boom we can see that equilibrium got hit inverse for value gap got hit um, you could probably scale down into the one minute um Find a breaker structure the upside boom cool enter right here take profit, you know find Some sort of confluence over here Um Oh Um find some sort of take profit based off this I'm gonna find a way to pause this. Okay. Wow. I can't even pause it. Holy shit. All right Okay, well, okay, um here Okay Okay, um Okay Whatever But anyways you guys see this this was a 15 minute bearish for value gap we get a closure above that we retest it and then boom price moves higher we take out these highs Cool, cool, cool, could have taken like a small little like one two Fucking I don't know if you enter right here take Robert right here I don't know you might have gotten like one to one wrist reward on that if you're entering off the one minute time frame I'm fighting for my life. Okay, fuck it. This is gonna be really weird. I might take you guys with me I hope no one steals my shit. Okay Fuck it. Let's go go yard backpack with like 150k worth of watches just sitting out in the open. That's rally I hope they don't find this sauce. I'm just gonna act like I'm on a business meeting with you guys This is so weird me walking into the bathroom But yeah guys Um Print out the balance sheet Damien. I'm sick and tired of this shit Damien you have to print that shit out and if you don't you're fired Sorry, I had to act professional. This is so weird. Okay, I'm gonna kind of hide you guys I Stay calm Oh Wow If you're asking if I wash my hands the answer is no, you know why? Because if you touch your penis when you go pee Like what Like it's a urinal for a reason like that bitch spray You know like I'm literally just ripping my shorts down and just unloading the clip Wow All right That was a risky play boys anyways Gulliard bag still here Locked and loaded Okay, so let's lock back in anyways Wow, I feel so much better. I can actually focus. Okay, let's go to mq See if we have an example of this Wow boys, I can literally like breathe again Okay, we don't have the invalidation until all the way up here Okay, let's try and find More examples of this wow, I feel so much better guys infinitely better off the shit It was good like the five minute some boo she died a Oh, here we go, okay Right here, okay I mean just this leg down I'm assuming that this was like a big ass sweep of liquidity. There we go Okay, we swept out all these lows. I'm pretty sure this was on like CPI or some high impact news day if I remember correctly That was so crazy. I can't believe you guys want to pee with me anyways. We come down downstairs. We sweep this out Okay, from here When do we get the invalidation of the fair value gap right here? We don't necessarily get a break of structure But okay, this can be one of our confluences. Okay, we come back down into this fair value gap um again or into this inverse fair value gap again What other confluences are we hitting? We're hitting equilibrium off the back end boom Yeah, chill Boom, okay, we hit equilibrium and then we get a break of structure right here that price ends up Moving higher. Okay That's pretty much all that it is. Okay, I'm not necessarily a huge fan of Using inverse fair value gaps like getting tapped back into as like a confluence to take a trade off of but I am a fan of seeing Fair value gaps getting Validated and taking trades Based off of that. Okay, so I'm again like yeah, you get better entries by price coming back down and like retracing into it But we already have so many other confluences where like I bet if we go into the one minute on that shit Damn come on guys If we go into the one minute, I'm sure we can find Something right like boom huge one minute fair value gap within here. Okay, break of structure right here Bet like long john silver off of that You know take profits. Oh T. Dove Okay Okay, this is like another example of this. I mean one minute fair value gap. There's a shit ton of like bearish One minute fair value gaps within here. Okay, it gets invalidated. We come down We fill my guess as we hit equilibrium off the back end on this piece Boom we come down fill equilibrium bullish reaction up. Okay It's like they're building the fucking great pyramids of Giza out here like hauling two ton fucking rocks and wheelbarrow's right next to my shit Anyways, we invalidate this bearish for value gap. We get a closure above cool confluence one confluence to we already had a break of structure. Okay And then boom we come down into Equilibrium we get a bullish reaction out of that cool. You can long off that stops under our invalidation point Which would have been off of equilibrium or Fuck it. You can put it underneath This fair about this bearish for about the last bearish for value gap. That's all the way down here that got invalidated Whatever you guys want to do But this is just another confluence that I said I wanted to make a video on because I use it use it occasionally Kind of as like a supporting confluence and also sometimes occasionally as an entry confluence So there we go not really much else to say on this again. This is a good example Okay, we push up invalidate this for value gap. We come back into it scale into the five minutes See if there's anything juicy within here. Uh not really we sweep out these five minute lows We can see if we're getting ackey on the one minute um But yeah There's Inverse for value gaps Explained slash Invalidation of fair value gaps Explained for one we already know like if a fair value gap gets invalidated Within our trade bias cool. It just is invalidated. We're no longer using it as a confluence and If we see a fair value gap in the opposite direction of our bias And it gets invalidated we can use it as a confluence and we're gonna teach you guys something that I've been using for Honestly the past Bro, I don't even I can't even remember How long it's been and again y'all are gonna clown me because I thought I found out this shit On my own And turns out it's a fucking iCT concept But I'm gonna and again I haven't seen iCT's fucking video on this so if I'm explaining it wrong I'm not trying to explain it the way that he explains it. I'm gonna explain it how I understand the shit for what it is cool cool so today We're going to be talking about Something that iCT calls a bpr Which honestly is like a he loved bro. He's nasty with those three letter Fucking changeups that he just pops in there. Oh, yeah that fbg me iCT you bpr You know what that means Baroque bitch syndrome I don't fucking know but anyways this is combining pretty much inverse fair value gap along with fair value gaps to just pretty much encapsulate a imbalance price range so Before we even show this on the charts, I kind of want to give you guys an idea of what this would be So let's say um, we have a violent moop Sam right already lagging out We have a violent move up and we form like a bullish imbalance right here And then we have like some movement over here and then we see price boom Get another violent move down and we form boom a bearish imbalance here That's like or if you don't i'll make it a little bit less like fucking crazy bearish imbalance right here Okay, and we see boom this is imbalance price action and this is imbalance price action when we see A bullish imbalance get formed and then disrespected Along with once it gets disrespected seeing a bearish imbalance form or overlap With that bullish imbalance We can safely assume sorry. I didn't even realize the microphone was just moaning in your ear But we can safely assume and say like hey imbalance price range imbalance price range This whole price range right here is imbalanced So what can we expect if price comes back up in this bitch And we start seeing downward movement it's going to continue lower Is it something fucking special? No, is it something that Is even necessary not really but It's just another confluence you know, and this is something that i've been mentioning a lot in a lot of my trade recap And yeah, it's pretty much just two fair value gaps that overlap in the opposite direction showing us a Just a super solid super awesome imbalance price range that price will more than likely want to come back and balance out Cool, so let's show this in action on the chart Okay, yeah, so like this is a perfect example right here So right here Right we see this boom Violin candle to the upside and and mainly for these guys we're not fucking And On foot finder like trying to zoom all the way the fucking and catch the toes of like an itsy bitty spider fair value gap, okay We're not trying to do that. We're looking for like the dick size candlesticks You know what i'm saying? Barry Woods on this guy All right You know this is tjr. This is like yonness all right So we see this bullish imbalance right here right we see it gets tapped into whatever That's not even when we're talking And then we see boom price Like Little uzi ver flooded the face now we have this big-ass bearish imbalance right here right? You see the part where the bearish imbalance and the bullish imbalance overlap yeah, that's the part that we want to boom Identify And that's what our bprs it's pretty much saying hey From here up to here that's our really high-quality imbalance price range because we see two fair value gaps that got formed right But What is the actual imbalance price range? It's where they overlap Because we can see on this price got balanced out down to this wick and Down to here Price got balanced out down to this wick essentially Because we see price blood all the way through there and as we're pushing back up through here It also gets balanced out this was also a news candle Okay, but we can see that this works perfectly Right here right we obviously get a little leg up and then boom consolidation, but we can see the tippy-de-top is boom Where these two fair value gaps overlap okay, let's find another example To show this off Let's go down into the smaller time frames and you're probably asking how do you use this? I'm not necessarily looking at these on a high time frame again We can apply any of these confluences Whenever the fuck we want on whatever time frame, but most of the time when I'm using this it's more so during entries so How about we scale down to like A actual area where it would be beneficial Okay, so let's see if we can see anything going on in here Okay, yeah, this is a great example right here You know So right here we see K dick candles up dick candles down Again in comparison to the four-hour chart and those news candles. It's nothing too special But it's it's at least something Okay, we see right here. This is the bullish imbalance Damn, I don't even know if that hit. Oh, it didn't hit it We have this one as well though Okay, so we have this bullish imbalance this bullish imbalance both of them get invalidated after this candlestick and then we have this bearish imbalance right here Honestly, we can go ahead and leave both of these babies on here Okay, because they both overlap This we could honestly just like bring this one up so it's just the sliver right there Okay, but we can see price pushes back into Where the bearish imbalance overlaps the bullish imbalance and it barely misses this top one right here And then price continues down And again, what's the difference between using this and a fair value gap Again, it's not much right we very well could have just used this bearish imbalance But it's higher confluence because we can see hey This is a much I guess Higher attracted area Where prices go in and want to fill its imbalance because not only do we have a bearish imbalance But we had a previous bullish imbalance and prices still moving swiftly through that area So we when we move swiftly through it to the upside we're like okay cool But then when we move through it swiftly to the downside it's like okay this whole area right here Sorry, I realized the microphone was still up a little bit too high This whole area right here is still in balance and prices going to want to come come back through and balance that out Let's try and find another example of this Friday's price action was pretty shitty, but we can still We can still kind of show this right here Even though this wouldn't necessarily have gone out in our gone in our direction again We're trying to use this for entries Assuming that there is an entry within here. I just kind of want to go over how we can identify these things so Right here again similar situation. We have a bullish imbalance right here Bullish imbalance right here. We have another one right here These the bullish and the bearish imbalance right here pretty much dead fucking even and then we have another bearish imbalance Right here Okay, we can leave this here we can Shrink this guy up to where it overlaps boom and then we just have a more centralized area where prices likely going to react off awful again this is Whatever speculative because Don't even know the bias going into the day um But yeah, oh this is like a decent example. Let's see if we can go in on the five minute here Oh damn wait did I completely remove? Okay, it's on the five minute here. We have this bullish imbalance or sorry bearish imbalance This bullish imbalance boom shrink this down Boom we can see that this Is like just fucking optimal range right we see swift move through swift move through Also beneficial that we see a lot of consolidation again, we have liquidity sweeper okay But boom we can see price comes back down into this area ripper Okay, let's show some more examples on higher timeframes Let's see how Might be difficult on the daily Let's go on the four hour here See if I can see any obvious ones off rib This is a good one Okay, so right here We have boom super swift move up Right here Super swift move down We can boom Shrink that up to where they overlap mink Boom this is our high quality imbalance price range Okay, let's see This is another one right here we can see swift moves up swift moves down there's a whole bunch of air value gaps within here There's bullish one Sparish one And this bolt this bearish one doesn't fit with the bullish one so We can actually just leave this right here because the bullish one fully encapsulates that So that's the one that we want to be targeting Boom price pops its head into it flush work But as you guys can see these these things are like all over the place Similar example right here bullish And a bearish Boom Okay, we have big flush up big flush down shrink this bad boy So it's a line Okay price pushes up into it flood of the face to the downside and again Keep in mind this is Going to be used with bias in mind This is going to be used with finding the optimal price range on like the 15 minute to five minute time frame to look for entry right we're looking for like liquidity suite Then we're looking for break of structure And then when we are able to scale down to the lower time frame like our execution time frame That's when we can use these to our advantage. Is this something that's like Maker fucking break We need to use this in our trade no But is this something that official that you can use as extra confluence like Hey, there's a fair value gap Right here and there's also a fair value gap right here And I don't know which one I should choose because right now it's in this one And it looks like it's going to go down But it might come up to this one and we also see a big-ass bullish imbalance that's like Right here Boom shrink work Delete delete this is the most like this is the most likely area that price is going to be looking to fill Why because there was a bullish imbalance along with a bearish imbalance. This is the most in this is the most imbalance price range cool Cool hello lover boy slime ball Backdoor slat What is happening is my shit crooked Does my shit look crooked to you guys hold on Bro, why is it crooked technical difficulties anyways. We are in the Miami setup the views nice look at the view guys Look at my view This is what I see out of when I'm looking at you guys pretty sexy But regardless we are going to get into probably the easiest concept ever in the entire world Today called equilibrium Okay So we have covered liquidity sweeps or just liquidity. We have covered break of structure We've covered order blocks. We've covered fair value gaps now. We're getting to equilibrium And then we'll also get into breaker blocks and then from there We can Put it all together and then make you guys actually learn the strategy that I've been talking about for fucking ever now Or really just the past month and you guys have been feeding for it So without further ado, let's get into equilibrium. Let's make this nice to quick because it's pretty fucking easy, okay? So Equilibrium Okay, we'll talk about what is it why it's beneficial to us and why we would potentially want to use it, okay? So what is it it measures The point Hey, so it measures the point from swing high to swing low or vice versa Oops Damn come on I feel like I'm typing on a typewriter um Boom Okay, so equilibrium measures the point from swing high down to swing low or vice versa so swing low to swing high Where price is in a premium or a discount? Okay, so it measures The it measures premium and discount from swing low to swing high or swing high to swing low Just depending on what trend it's in okay, we'll get into that later tomorrow or the next day talking about how to how to identify this But this is what we know equilibrium helps us identify premium in a discount now. Let's break this down. Let's figure out how is this beneficial to us also. Sorry. It sounds like I'm talking enough I What were we even talking about right the reason why this is beneficial to us Let's put this in human terms, okay When you guys go to the grocery store, imagine the most delicious the most Electable your favorite food on earth you go to the grocery store and it's 50% off Are you gonna buy it? Yeah, you're probably slamming your card down and buying it 10 times Okay on the contrary If you guys go to the grocery store and that same item is 2x the price You're probably not as maybe you buy it, but you're probably not as willing To buy it right That's essentially what equilibrium is because we think about the banks the market makers They want the best price possible. They are looking to buy in a discount rather than a premium Okay, so that's what equilibrium does for us it It identifies a premium and a discounted price and because of this It's a continuation confidence Okay, so It's a continuation confidence. Okay, so Right are we going to be able to identify where price is going to reverse Based off equilibrium will know but if we think about this is kind of getting into identifying it But if we think about higher highs and higher lows If we see oh Right within here is a discounted price It's more than likely if we see buying power out of that Price is going to continue up Right, so there's a little hint going into tomorrow or whenever I film the next video Okay, but it helps us identify premium and discounted price and because of this it's beneficial for us Because when we're able to identify that premium price If we see price like barely dip down into a premium and then continue higher we can say okay that probably wasn't the best time to enter Versus if we see price dip down into a discounted price and we see strong buying pressure At a bit or buying confluence is at a bit Then we can say okay, yeah, that would make sense This paired with another confluence this paired with like a fair value gap and order block Okay, a breaker block that we'll get into later This paired with that It would make sense that there's buying power or selling power out of this equilibrium or this discounted price Because it was on discounted and because We're able to buy it at a cheaper price Cool, okay, so super easy day today talking about equilibrium finding premium versus discounted price from a swing high to a swing low or a swing low to a swing high All right, that being said see you guys tomorrow as you guys know we talked about equilibrium yesterday Talked about what it is how it helps us so today we're going to talk about literally the easiest confluence ever To be able to identify so this should be relatively quick and again I'm not teaching how you teaching you guys how to enter yet work super close Next up is breakers and then after that we can put everything together and I can spend like hours Showing you guys how to put stuff together, okay, but for now We're talking about equilibrium and how to identify it on the chart So like I was saying yesterday we identify with a swing from a swing low to a swing high or from a swing lot Swing like hi try to swing high down to a swing low, okay Thank you I am sorry Moving forward we identify it from a swing low to a swing high within an uptrend Within a downtrend we take it from The swing high down to the swing low and you're probably asking Oh you um the handsome boy in the front No, no, not the one that I'm pointing at that one Um what Mr. What's a swing high what's a swing low I'm gonna tell you It's literally just the higher high and the higher low within the uptrend so if we think about You're Beautiful the best uptrend I've ever drawn in my driven in my Drove in my entire lives In an uptrend we take it from the low up to the high Okay, so we want to be able to find the discounted price right because we know that Equilibrium is identifying premium price and discounted price and why is that beneficial to us because if we see price go into a discount and then within an uptrend If we see buying power come out of that discount we can assume okay buy orders were filled because it was at a discounted price and price is going to continue higher Okay, wow that was so hard That was so smarter. Okay now How do we identify this I use the gand box Okay, and it's literally identified by the 50% mark or the halfway point From the swing low to the swing high. Okay, so we take it from the low And just drag it boom up to the high and as we can see My perfectly driven drone drone drone Down uptrend Dipped perfectly into our discounted price Which is underneath here right because anything up here Would be premium and anything down here is a discount Everything up here is a premium why because it's higher prices and we're in an uptrend and we're looking to buy So when as price goes lower it's cheaper for us to buy okay So Everything underneath the halfway point from the swing low to the swing high is going to be a discount Okay, we see price come into the discount. We see buying power come out price continues higher Okay Boom, let's do it again from the low to the high we see price boom come down Again, perfectly drawn Uptrend we come right into the discount. We see buying power come out price goes high Last time our beautifully drawn uptrend Okay, we take it from the low up to the high Price again perfectly comes into our discounted price range We see buying power come out price continues high. Okay, now let's talk about it in a downtrend See if I can drive this one as good as I drove the other one It's already worse Let's try again It's already really bad. It's really bad It's that's as good as it's going to get wow, okay, that's better Okay In a downtrend we take it from the swing high it's literally just the inverse the swing high down to the swing low Okay, so boom We have our game box here you guys want to see my settings on this this is what I have my setting time take a screenshot take a picture You got your pictures cool Okay We take our game box from the swing high down to the swing low perfectly driven downtrend We see price boom from high down to the low we see price We see price get into the discounted price range which is now This above area and this is the premium right because we're trying to short it so we want to short at a higher price And buy it back at a lower price Okay, so boom We see price get into that discounted price range we see selling power come through And push it lower price continues in that direction Okay, let's keep doing this And then we'll start going into how to identify it on actual real time Okay moving forward. Okay swing high down to swing low price pushes Into the discount discounted price range we see selling power push out price continues lower Okay One more time swing high down to the swing low We see price push into the discounted price range we see selling power come out price continues lower Okay, and again, this is similar to fair value gaps similar to order blocks It is a continuation confluence So does price require this to happen to move when we're within a trend does price have to Go into that discount no, but if it does it's a higher confluence for us To assume that price is going to continue higher. So if we look at this as like an uptrend We see boom. This is the high. This is the low. Okay, and then from here we want it here We see this is the low. Okay, because we take it from swing low to swing high and then we see this high gain There's going to be times where you see like a little hip squeak of a low gain made and you're probably thinking hey It never came underneath equilibrium And that's okay because sometimes the market moves and doesn't hit our confluence And you just have to accept that okay, but for the next Swing low to swing high we can see oh it did go into a discount and we did see buying her power out of it So price is probably going to continue higher. Okay, and that's how we have to treat it Okay, so now let's do this super simply super duper easy. We'll find examples of this within every single timeframe and every single trend Okay, and we'll just go and show this work So boom, we're in a downtrend. How do we know that move down then to move up? We find the lowest point of those two candles right here. We see breaker structure of the downside Cool, we're in a downtrend. We take it from the swing high move up move down high is pointing those Those two candles to swing low move down then to move up we take it to the lowest point of those two candles. Okay, let me just extend this Okay, what do we see we see price Push up into a discounted price point we see selling power come out price moves lower Okay, same thing swing high Down to swing low we see price push on up in there right obviously the move up Then we see price continue lower Okay, now we get a breaker structure to the upside now we're in an uptrend. Okay, we take swing low To the swing high we see price boom come into the discounted price range buying power out price continues higher It's going to a smaller timeframe and identify this And again, it's not going to happen every single time Hmm, let's do this one like the weekly actually Okay, we get a breaker structure to the upside right here Boom we're in an uptrend take it from the swing low move down then to move up Boom to the swing high move up then to move down boom we see price poke Into the discount buying power out price continues higher Okay Just trying to find another example of this um Right here we're in a downtrend we break structure to the downside The swing high Down to swing low we see price boom push up into equilibrium Selling power out of it price continues lower for a bit Okay, and this is all it is it's just helping us When price is retracing down it just helps us say hey If it's the same thing with order blocks is the same thing with fair value gaps is the same thing with breaker blocks It's the same thing with equilibrium What do these Continuation confluences help us they help us identify areas where if we see buying power or selling power out of them That if those if if those areas get hit and we see buying power and selling power out of them Then we can safely assume that those were good confluences that more orders were filled and prices going to continue in the direction That it wanted to go in versus Something like this if it's in like an uptrend like I don't freaking know something like that right like and let's say there's no fair value gaps no order blocks And it's just like the tiniest little moves down right like we probably don't want to be entering on that When do we want to be entering when we know the market is filling more orders And we know that it's a high probability area Where more orders can have the possibility to be filled and then we wait for confluences out of those high probability areas What are our high probability areas order blocks breaker blocks fair value gaps in equilibrium And all that we're doing with those is Identifying them on the chart when price retraces and if it goes into those price ranges and we see buying power or selling power out of it Depending on the trend we can safely assume that price is going to likely continue in the direction that it was gone Cool Cool awesome that wraps up equilibrium part two we have breaker blocks And then it's time to be serious and then we're going to start putting things together all right boys I appreciate you guys we'll see you guys in the next one. We will get this up and active all right breaker blocks Let's get started. We're talking about breaker blocks Okay, so similar with all the other concepts. We're just going to type this bitch out and Okay, fine walking Geez bro, y'all get me way too into the shit. Okay Breaker block come on, bro literally almost just yelled. I'm demonetized anyways. I'm I just well say no I'm just kidding. I'm not gonna say geez. Okay, let's not say it Never mind. It's national woman's month anyways wait We don't care about that anyways. Okay breaker blocks with law. Okay. I'm just kidding Huh, okay lock in breaker blocks What is it? So breaker blocks a lot of people describe breaker blocks as failed order blocks But that's also because a lot of people teach order blocks differently Okay, so It's actually what I failed order block Let's let's rewind this. I don't even want you guys to see this and be like oh we're looking for failed order blocks No, it's not the case. Okay All I want you guys to look at it as I Wanted to explain that before we whoa. I'm not looking as orange anymore, but Everybody describes it as a failed order block. I only consider order blocks the initial the initial Move up that sweeps liquidity But a lot of people will identify order blocks as every single move up so they consider this in order block They can consider this in order block Okay, and what happens With this is when we get Okay, rewind When we get the breaker structure of the upside they pretty much say okay, this this is now a failed order block So when price revisits it it's called a breaker Okay, so hopefully that helps you guys understand it a little bit more Again, when we go into identifying them. I'll show you guys a lot better But that's what I wanted to show you guys. It's essentially a a leg up or where orders a price range Where orders Could have potentially have been filled within The initial trend direction, but price broke structure Okay, sweet market shift shifted directions Okay, so it turned into a price range Where Orders could have been filled in the initial direction of the overall trend Wasn't able to and when price revisits it Orders are going to be able to be filled there Within that direction to the upside because it was failed So we know that there's no longer any more Cell side orders in this in this case this bullish breaker block We know that there's no more cell orders within this price range. Does that make sense because before Again with that idea that Every single move up within a downtrend Is in order block which I don't consider Okay, but let's say that every single retracement they consider that in order block And again, I don't want you guys to get this confused, but let's just call it retracements Within these retracements we see that more cell orders get filled right But what happens when price pushes all the way through that This price range no longer has any cell orders to offer So if price revisits it it's super similar to a fair value gap where there's a lack of cell orders within here So if we see buying pressure out of it price will continue higher Oh Crazy, okay, so let's show it Another direction as well Sorry, I just had to do that Okay, with an uptrend Oh Usually uptrends are my best Okay, so again within an uptrend They consider all those down moves order blocks, but we'll just call them retracements because it Makes it a little bit simpler for us. So Within these retracements, right? We know that more buy orders are able to get filled within these price ranges, right? More buy orders were able to get filled price one higher more buy orders were able to get filled price one higher So when price ends up breaking structure When these price ranges end up not being able to offer enough more buy orders to get filled And we see price revisited And we know that hey, there's a lack of buy orders within here And we see selling power out of it we can assume That price is going to continue lower And that's all that breaker blocks are Okay, so it was oops, no Damn it, I went back too far So all that breaker blocks are a retracement Followed by a break of the current trend It's a retracement followed by a break up Shutter wow horrible selling opposite of the current trend Which Then makes that price And we see that And we see that And we see that And we see that And we see that price range Lack I slash sell Or do Depending on Read Okay, so it's a retracement followed by a break up structure Opposite of the current trend Which then makes that price range that was the retracement price range Re-trace Note Lack Buy slash sell orders again, depending on the previous trend So that's what it is and well, how is that beneficial to us If price Revisits That area We can assume that if there Is selling Slash buying Pressure out of it Price will Continue in that Direction due to Be lack of orders From Be previous Trim Okay, so why is it useful to us if price revisits that area we can assume That if there was if there is buying and selling pressure out of that price range Price will continue into that direction Due to the lack of orders from the previous trend that was just broken Right, so the visual was honestly like the best way for me to explain that Right, we're in a trend Right in each each retracement kind of serves as like a little price range. Oops. Sorry each retracement kind of serves as a price range where more Potential orders could be filled And if we break past that price range we can assume that there's a lack Of in this case Sell orders within here. So again similar to fair value gaps if we see price reach into here And then we see buying pressure out of that within a price range where there's a lack of sell orders We can assume that price is going to continue higher Oh Breaker blocks explained part one. I will see you guys in part two We already explained breaker blocks talked about how they're useful to us today We're going to get into identifying them. Okay, so There should be relatively easy. We're just going to draw these bitches out and then we are going to go ahead and identify them on the chart And again Why are they useful to us because there's a lack of orders going in the opposite direction right so we have oops Okay, so if we have an uptrend Like this right We can consider these retracements Areas where sell orders were getting filled right we see boom more sell orders getting filled price moves down Because of it then we see boom a break of structure Okay, right within here is our breaker block Right and we know if price revisit this again. This is another one of our continuation confluence is We can see that there's going to be a lack of sell orders within here We see buying power out of it prices likely going to continue higher super similar to a fair value gap Okay, honestly parent with a fair value gap is a pretty awesome confluence And then now let's go into boom and uptrend Right every single one of these Legs down these retracements More by orders getting filled Okay, this is our breaker block prior to breaking structure right and we know that within here there is a lack Of By orders so when price pushes in here and we see selling power out of it We can assume the price is going to go lower why because when price entered through it It was able to go cleanly pass it and break structure Cool now. Let's go into identifying them The easiest way to identify them Is looking at them like this it's literally the like the opposite of an order block Okay, so a bullish Breaker is going to be the move down prior to the breaker structure a bearish breaker is the move move down prior to breaker structure to the downside boom boom and then a bullish breaker Is going to be the move up prior to the breaker structure to the downside boom Cool cool. Let's get into identifying these babies These babies by by by by by this by this Let's move into some better price action. I really have not traded much at all over the past Really like two weeks Put this into like a higher time frame See if we can see anything nice Okay Perfect example right here Okay, so we have boom We have this is the break with this is the breaker structure right here right Boom we want to find the the move up prior To the breaker structure to the upside okay, we have two situations here Typically for me right I'm looking for the leg down that causes like the liquidity suite Either way you can mark either of these As the breaker with this right which ones the move up prior to the breaker structure of the upside We see the breaker structure of the upside right here on the hourly Okay, we have this boom this up candle and this whole up candle breaker right here If you wanted to you could also consider this a breaker Okay, because typically what we like to what some people like to do Is they like to identify the legs up prior to the liquidity suite and we can see that this is the liquidity suite But in reality, right we see that this offered a better entry Okay, let's go and Find a more clear example of this and there's one right here Okay, we see a boom big leg up break the structure to the downside What do we want to do we want to find the move down boom prior To the breaker structure to the downside to find that bearish breaker block Right we see that big leg up okay, we see price break structure boom we see it revisit We see selling power out of it Boom price continues lower Okay, let's try and find more examples of this And again, is this one of those things where price is just Always one million trillion percent going to draw towards it just because it gets formed no definitely not But it's something that we can take note of and if we see it Draw into a breaker and if we see reactions out of it What can we say please soon that price is going to continue in that direction? Okay, all of these are just Confluences that help us Understand where price wants to go. Okay. This is another good example We have a breaker structure to the upside Right here off this candle Boom, let's see if price did price even get into this one. Oh, unfortunately not Okay, we got real close to this And this is when Right, we can highlight a couple things boom breaker Imbalances within here right all that But that was a break block See if we can find some on the low time frame Okay, here we go we had boom breaker structure the upside Right here we have the move up Prior to the breaker structure the upside. Okay, we see that boom slide little tap in. Okay, we get that rejection Boom continuation of the upside right here Price continues higher. What else do we have that combined with boom We have a fair value gap within here Okay, what can we also consider this black candle move down order block right? So now you're starting to see how all of our confluences can start to come together with this Let's do some more examples here Okay This one again, I'm just One I put things together this is literally just identifying it when we start putting things together It's going to make a lot more sense. We're just Drawing these out and showing them where again. This isn't going to be one of those things where you're just like oh, I see a breaker Boom, boom enter. No, that's not and great. I just lost my position Literally switched It's not going to be like oh breaker bet spam, you know like bye no bro like Focus, okay, like there's going to be several confluences that we wait for not just like fair value gap bet Or just like order block No No bro, okay, so boom we get a breaker structure at the downside Okay, we see the move down prior to the break boom we see price push on into it. Okay, we see rejection to the downside Price continues lower okay right here We get a breaker structure to the upside Boom we have to move up Prior to the breaker structure of the upside. Okay, boom. We see price revisit the breaker Price continues higher and like this is a perfect example of okay We closed past a fair value gap, but we also have a confluence here, right? This is getting a little bit into like putting shit together and I'm probably going to end this video soon because I'm pretty sure you guys get the gist of it When we see some of our confluences get invalidated, but we have other confluences, right? That doesn't necessarily mean like oh the fair value gap's gone Like fucking radic here. No Right We got to sit here and realize like okay, we got a breaker structure to the upside. Okay, fair value gap It got invalidated, but boom we sell this breaker block that it could be drawing towards boom. We see buying power out of it. Okay price continues higher Right here we see a breaker structure to the downside Okay, where's the move down prior to the breaker structure this is the downside Right here. Okay, see we see price push on up in here into the breaker. Okay. We see selling power out of it price continues lower Okay, and again This is like it's easy for me to just go on here and just be like bing bong bong blah blah blah blah Watch perfect it works It's not going to work every single fucking time. I'm cherry picking these but I'm cherry picking these so that you guys can see Exactly what the fuck a breaker is Before we get into actually putting this shit together and trust me when we put this shit together It's going to be really fucking easy for you guys. Okay But with that being said I'm pretty sure you guys know how to identify these bitches now We're locked we're loaded We're here to talk about SMT divergence So without fall though, dude today we had SMT divergence today during pre-market We had a perfect example of SMT divergence. I'm going to try and explain this pretty simply so that you guys can understand All the SMT divergence is is one index Forecasting what another index is going to do So today for example, I was bullish because on the four-hour time frame We were bullish on the hourly We weren't bullish, but on the four-hour we were and on NASDAQ we came down and we swept out these hourly lows Let's get rid of like everything Except for the SMT divergence because that's all that this should just about So what we know our biases bullish right NASDAQ makes this low and then it makes a higher low up here During the same point in time. Okay, so we have this low and then this low During the same point in time see this was the mark out from the stream ES makes this low when NASDAQ makes this low and then ES makes a lower low When NASDAQ makes that significantly higher low this was a really drastic Example of it typically it's going to be a lot less Less of something like that where like the higher low will be right here but but For a bullish SMT One index creates a higher low while the other index creates a lower low In pretty much all that it's doing is this In this case and Q is forecasting and saying hey We made a higher low on NQ but on ES we made a lower low at the same time that and come on at the same time that NQ made a higher low It's this is like a fortune teller It's telling us that ES is likely going to go higher So when I see that ES is probably going to draw into these 15 minute highs and then these 15 minute highs why Because of the SMT divergence Okay, so the best way that I can explain at SMT is one find your bias because if you don't have a bias then you'll be finding SMT divergences that are that are conflicting right so you have to have your overall bias and we knew that our oh Okay Oh, we should okay that our overall bias was bullish coming into New York session even on ES, okay now we're bearish, but anyways besides that we were bullish coming into market open Same thing here on NASDAQ Okay, so when we scale down on the lower time frame and we see NASDAQ Create this low and then a higher low but ES create this low and then a lower low We can assume that ES is going to continue higher Okay, and we can use that to our advantage. I know a lot of people that This is fucking huge bro like a lot of people will say like oh, yeah, I don't even take I think Darius says he doesn't even take trades if The SMT if if his setup doesn't have an SMT in it or if like the leb the high time frame level that price is pushing into If it does if he they don't see a if he doesn't see an SMT he's like I'm not taking it Okay, so let's find another example of this Why do most trade why are most traders like gay as fuck Pause Really Okay, yeah, another wasn't an SMT here Let's see if there was anything off those highs There you go, okay bet good example here Okay, this isn't necessarily for market open but anyways Let's just say for example Let's say we're bearish Okay, and end you we make this high and then we make this high ES also coming into a high time frame liquidity sweep, okay We come into a high time frame level NQ makes come on Right NQ makes a high than a lower high yes Comes through Makes a high and then a higher high so if our bias is bearish Right and we only use this is another thing that when we're looking for bullish SMT we're only using the lows and when when we're looking for bearish SMT We're only only looking for highs so we come into this high time frame level high time frame liquidity sweep And ES makes a high than a higher high but NQ At the same time Makes a high then a lower high so we can go in on ES and be like I bet I've been a place a bit Okay And we can say okay Nasdaq is telling us the future Because it made a lower high Obviously make sure it's in line with our bias and then from there we can scale down And try and find entries, okay, so we and all another thing another huge thing I do not like to use SMT divergence on the one minute typically my SMT divergence is going to be on the five minute or the 15 minute And it also works really well for high time frame. Oh, this is another perfect example Okay, but anyways, this was during pre-market so not much of like entry work to be found within here But you can still see that it holds true because price ends up coming down taking out liquidity Um and on nasdaq nasdaq smoking on the gas back okay, it did the same thing But came down sweat of liquidity. This is another good example of how we can use it to find bias Okay, because on ES right we have This high and then a lower high and then on NQ we have this high And then a higher high Okay And on Well from there we can see that price wanted to come down sweep out this liquidity pretty short lived Okay, like down, but we can see that when we have this price It's pretty much Telling us the future of where the other index wants to go Oh, I could clickbait the buck out of this put some crazy thumbnail S and like how to tell the future on the timeframes Let's find more examples of this being go was his name out Okay, look here On ES Okay, my guess is this okay first of all we see a high time frame liquidity sweep This had to have been like CPI or something PPI but regardless we can still apply this Okay, boom we come through we sweep out lows bias Bolish after we probably get like an hourly close above here Okay We have this low right here We form a lower low down here but on NQ We have this low right here And then we have a higher lower right here. So what can that tell us the future about on ES Because then Q made a higher low SMT divergence as well as Us seeing ES Not breaking structure on this low sweeping these lows out We can scale down to lower timeframes and find entries Within here, right because we made a lower low on ES But a higher low on NQ we can scale down into ES We see these lows get swept and finally we can Probably find some sort of entry within here, okay? So the main thing that I want you guys to remember from today for SMT divergence because it's hard for me to go back in time And tell myself don't change that thing but All right, this one on SMT Okay What to look for Okay, when we're bullish And we're coming into when we have a bullish bias and we come into a bullish level we're looking for higher low formed on Either of the indexes And Lower low Formed on the other okay, and then typically we're looking to execute on the other one because If we see a higher low formed on one index index like let's say let's say we see a higher low formed on gas pack And we see a lower low formed on SMP it means the SMP is lagging behind Nasdaq so the SMPs likely going to follow suit and continue higher So that that means there's going to be more opportunity on ES Okay, and then continuing when we are bearish lower high formed on one index and And a higher high And a higher high on the other Okay, because again When we're bullish and we see This on one that index And this on the other we can assume that this one is going to follow suit Of this one for bullish and then for bearish if we see This on one And this on the other we can assume that this is going to follow suit of that index Okay, so pretty straight straight forward. This is just another confluence to add to your List of tools. Okay, that being said. I appreciate you guys I'll catch you guys in the next one. If you guys haven't already please like please subscribe y'all are my people I'll catch you guys so I know that was a lot of information for you guys to digest and that's a whole bunch of Confluences and you guys are like what the fuck am I even supposed to do with this? Hopefully you guys are starting to like piece the pieces together and you guys are like okay cool I know that draws on the quidity are where price is going to reverse off of I know for value gaps are where price is looking to balance out price action and then react off of it I know that break of shudder is showing a change in trend you guys have all of these concepts and you guys have all of these Patterns and price action formations that help you guys dictate where price is going to go now We are going to put these confluence is together in order to predict where price action wants to go because again Like I was saying in those other videos These are nothing just by themselves. We need to put all of these together in congruence So that we are able to make a highly probable decision when looking to make a trade within the markets because again These confluence is standing alone are little to nothing But when we put them together it helps us make a highly probable decision within the market So again, this is going to be me putting all of these confluence is together for you guys so that you guys can say Hey, boom, we're looking for liquidity suite then from there break the shudder then from there for value gap getting filled And then from there we're going to scale down on this time frame and then we're going to enter All of that is going to be put together in place so that you guys can form and build a strategy to finally be able to start making predictions On where price wants to go again This is going to take some time and it's going to take a lot of brain effort So if you guys need to whatever split this up or just write it down on each step that's okay And with that being said, let's jump straight into how we can actually get into strategy creation And again, if you guys are struggling with this on confluencees or with the strategy creation and you guys are like man I wish I could just talk to Tyler one on one again You guys can go ahead click the link in the description and join the blueprint where you guys are going to be able to submit trades to people like me People like my coaches and you guys are going to say hey, did I use this confluence correctly? Is this trade of the good trade to take because again? I can only do so much on these YouTube videos where I just cast this massive umbrella this massive net where I just say Hey, you guys are going to want to do this this this this then this but I'm not able to actually correct you guys in real time When you guys are attempting to do these things and that's where a lot of my struggle was when I was an unprofitable trader Where I would learn these concepts and then I would go to apply them But because I was a beginner and because I was an unprofitable trader I didn't necessarily know if I was making the right decisions or if I was using the confluencees correctly And I had to do it based off of my own knowledge that I had and just based off these YouTube videos The benefit of having a mentor and the benefit of having a coach right by your side is you guys can use these confluencees And then you guys can show it to your coach someone like me other profitable coaches and then say was I doing this correct? And we could be like whoa, dude You're completely screwing up the strategy and just that alone just that little tip that piece of advice could save you guys from six months Worth of mistakes that you guys keep making over and over again But you guys don't even know that you're making that mistake over and over again Because you guys think that you're marking out the confluence correct You guys think that you're placing the trades correctly But in turn you're not and it's super beneficial to have a coach like me or somebody else that is profitable within the markets To be able to see that and be like hey, I've made this mistake before and it cost me literally three months of losing over and over and over again Let me save you those three months of time and let me put you guys in the right position and let's adjust this this this this this this this And then boom your strategy's going to be perfect You now know how to identify these confluence is correctly instead of you guys just wasting all that time So if that sounds like something that you guys want to be a part of click the link down in the description for you guys to join the blueprint and That being said, let's jump into strategy creation We're going to be talking about systemizing your strategy you guys have to systemize your strategy What do I mean by that? I'm going to lay out different tools for you guys to be able to take trades off of okay different confluence And eventually I'm going to give you guys my systemize strategy Okay, it's not it's not going to work for all of you guys some of you guys Think about trading differently again. Like I said that my shit doesn't work for you choose something else but When you choose something else Systemize it and this is probably why the majority of you guys are not able to Be profitable with like smc or ict concepts It's not that they don't work Is that you guys Don't have a system you guys don't have a step-by-step plan on how you're supposed to enter a trade if you guys just think of I don't know like any skill Like usually there's like a step-by-step Of how to do something or how to execute something or at least like people who are successful There is variables that are dependent and independent Okay, that's like part of like experiment. So when you guys are experimenting with your strategy You want to know what doesn't work and what does work So how the fuck are you supposed to know what doesn't work and what does work if you guys change your entry strategy Every fucking day so when you guys are trying to put these tools together a lot of you guys are going to fuck this up Really badly and I know I did this Like horribly and it caused me to be really unsuccessful for months until I figured out okay I have to have a systemized plan when you guys are getting into a trade You should have a step-by-step of how you are supposed to enter Because when you do that step-by-step you're able to Immediately say okay and you're able to look back on your losing trade and you're able to say okay 90% of the time when I enter off of order blocks. I lose I should stop entering off of order blocks remove that And you're able to directly identify This confluence is not working for me versus if you guys are just in a same thing like the timeframes The the confluence is if you guys entering the pair that you guys are trading all of these things matter And that's why you guys should simplify shit down where First thing like you guys should only be trading one pair second thing You guys should only be trading during one session Okay, because that just boom immediately one variable plug in for both of those things super easy Strategy we can't just have like green candle press-bop right? There's a couple more steps so that's why we want to simplify everything else Before we get into our execution and again We want to simplify our execution too or we want to systemize our execution So within our execution. This is what you guys shouldn't be doing You shouldn't be looking at the weekly then looking at the daily then looking at the four-hour then looking at the hour Then looking at the 15 minute then looking at the five minute then looking at the one minute And marking out every single confluence on every single one of those timeframes you're doing yourself a disservice And then along with that what you also shouldn't be doing is on Monday Let's say your bias is bullish and You found that by looking at the daily timeframe in the four-hour timeframe And then you entered on the one minute and you won And then on Tuesday Your bias is bearish and you found that by looking at the one hour and the four-hour and you entered on the 15 minute and you lost And then on Wednesday you looked at the weekly and the one hour and you took your trade off the one minute You see how that causes issues where your strategy is you guys are using Technically a different strategy every fucking day Because it's not systemize. It's not look at this timeframe this timeframe gives me an input Rotate to the next time frame because of that higher time frame input We get to go to the lower time frame input and then we make a decision on that from there We go to another time frame we make a decision on that based off those two inputs You guys should have a system of entry not just I see this I see this I go to this I see this I mark this I marked that and I enter it's not how that should should work You guys should see one time frame get a bias off of that and because of that bias you're able to go to another time frame Maybe both of those time frames are to help you find your bias right maybe you go on the daily and again You guys will see my system my strategy That's why I'm talking in like vague terms right now because I don't want You guys to jump ahead because you guys aren't even there yet, but I need to make this video For a lot of people because a lot of you guys are just shooting yourselves in the foot Okay, so like maybe your systemize strategy as I go on the daily timeframe And I see what the what what my bias is based on the overall trend And then I have that boom that's input one the bias on the daily is bullish We rotate to the four hour We see on the four hour the bias is still bullish Okay, so because of that we have two bullish biases two inputs And then because of those two inputs we're able to rotate To like the 15 minute timeframe and then we're looking for A sweep of high time frame liquidity and then from there we're looking for a brave shusher And then from there we're looking for one of my entry confluences Okay, whether that be like order block fair value gap equilibrium breaker block And then we're looking for reactions out of that See how that systemized we have we go from daily four hour 15 and that's not my strategy I just pulled that shit out of my ass. Don't don't use that We went from daily four hour overall bias rotate into 15 minute Confluence confluence entry It's a step-by-step program And then from there when you see okay when I enter off of an order block within that program I'm more likely to you lose because you're journaling all of your trades as you should I'm more likely to lose my probability when I'm trading off of order blocks Is a lot lower? Boom you no longer are able to trade off of order blocks your probability of winning goes higher Now we're trading daily four hour liquidity suite break of structure only enter off of fair value gap equilibrium breaker block Okay, we see that our probability is a lot lower off of equilibrium. We take that out probability of winning goes higher until you have literally a step-by-fucking-step program of being able to enter into a trade That one Won't give you a trade every single day, but two you know your probability is going to be so high Because you were able to take out all of those variables and you know what your probability is Going into every single day and every single trade Because of that step-by-step process that you guys laid out Where it's so easy where you literally can just sit on your hands And not do shit ever Until those steps have been completed And then once those steps get completed It's brainless work you press by or you press sell you set your stop loss you set your take profits And we're on our way That is how strategy should work it shouldn't be You like literally every single day you guys are trading a different strategy. I hope you understand that You guys are trading off of a different confluence every day You guys are finding your daily bias based off different timeframes every day You guys are entering you guys are and you guys problem you guys have like 30 different strategies that you guys are Trying to trade with every single day That you guys don't even know are 30 different strategies And you're labeling it as one strategy It's not one strategy right now what you guys are doing is you guys have a bunch of tools a bunch of confluences And you're just bundling them all up together in life throwing them at the chart And trying trying to get a winning trade out of it. That's not how this shit works Systemize your strategy and then you guys will be able to identify what's causing you to lose Versus right now your strategy is like I'm going to look at seven different timeframes and enter off of three different new confluences per day And you have no fucking clue why you're winning or why you're losing And then when you go to do your journaling you're literally guessing why you're why you're losing You're saying oh like it didn't work out for this no bro Like you got with the systemized strategy you guys will be able to see 80% of time when I enter off of like fair value gaps. I suck dick out that So I'm no longer going to do that boom that just takes away a fat chunk of your losing trades That boosts your profitability immediately by systemizing your strategy Until you guys can break it down and simplify it so much Where you guys literally just remove Everything that has low probability within your system so that your system is purely high probability So I wanted to make this video to hopefully help you guys Once are systemizing your strategy if you guys haven't already and to prepare you guys To make sure that once I do lay out all these tools for you guys you guys don't just go eight shit and start throwing hammers and nails and fucking wrenches At some shit without having any clue what you're doing and you know like then you guys will have and I will say I fucked up in the past like with the bootcamp like I fucked up where I didn't give you guys a systemized strategy I kind of just like assumed and that's probably the worst thing to do especially with people who are beginners You should never fucking assume this time around we're not doing that That's why we're changing the way of the the tool and confluence delivery We will be able to take systemized entries and exits And it's gonna be awesome and hopefully it takes you one step closer to being a higher probability and a more profitable trainer all for fucking free Let's get it The Figured we might as well start off with some some fucking patrioticness Before we give you guys the first piece Of the strategy Okay, so this is going to be one of many videos who knows how many parts this is going to take We're going to break this down as simple as possible for you guys Again, who knows how many parts this is going to take we're going to take as many parts as we need to in order for us to drill this shit into your guys as many As fucking brains Okay, so You guys remember our confluences. Yes, you guys remember everything that I've ever taught you ever in the entire world Right wrong So go back and re re re re Start off Welcome to the fucking strategy video That's a fucking strategy video bitterm Okay All right There's going to be several several parts of this To preface this this first one that I'm going to give you guys This is like Beginner and then as the rest of this goes on the more fucking advanced it's going to get Because there's going to be more and more things that we can add to this to make it better Okay, so you're probably going to watch this and be like T.D. Are you such a piece of shit you taught me the fucking basic bitch strategy Well guess what Little fucking Timmy you don't know shit about training yet So shut up and eat your pacifier your fucking binky Okay So basic bitch strategy Step by step here we go Okay Step one we treat our four-hour and our hourly as our daily bias and keep in mind There's a million other ways to trade this is just my strategy you guys want to trade like me this works for you cool Remember think back to our psychology videos think back to literally videos like one through five Or whatever it was before we started confluences watch those shits and remember what I was telling you guys about how This shit's going to take time and if my strategy doesn't make sense to you get the fuck out of here Okay, and I that's boom like I taught you something get the fuck out. Okay, if this shit doesn't make sense. So The way that I like to trade is I like to catch One to three hour moves. Okay, so ideally I'm in the market for one to three hours Sometimes it's a little bit less, but ideally I'm catching like a three hour movement, okay, so with that in mind are we really trying to figure out a Weekly move not necessarily So I like to stay away from the daily time frame because we look at the daily time frame That's really giving us some prediction of okay, where is the where the next couple days going to go I don't really give a fuck about that. We want to scale down one step lower and start looking at okay We're the next four hours going to go where the next hour is going to go. Okay, we're going to treat that as our daily bias or as our bias going into our trading day Okay, so treat Before hour and the one hour as Our bias Okay, so what does that mean look oh, chill out on look No lowercase Okay, look at four hour trend Okay, we're looking at the four hour and the one hour try What is something that we know that's just basic as shit higher time frames hold higher power right because if the four hour says Hey, look, we're gonna go fucking up and the hourly says wait no, we're gonna go down Longer term if the four hour time frame is saying we're going fucking up the hourly is probably hitting a fucking retrace on our eyes Okay, so with that in mind we want to look at the four hour trend and that's going to be our overall bias We see the four hour trend right is it a fucking up trend or is that a fucking downtrend simple as shit. We're not trying to predict Reversals we look at the four hour trend and we know okay This is where the next four hours are likely going to go Too bad so sad if you take a loss because the four hour break structure Ideally, we're not trying to capture reversals on the four hour Okay, we're trying to stay within the trend so Or bias is based on four hour trend if Oh Boom simple as shit Our bias our overall daily outlook on the day is based on the four hour trend of the four hours in an up trend What does that mean higher high higher lows breaking structure the upside cool? We're bullish if it's in the downtrend we are bearish lower lows lower highs Step four look at the one hour trend okay, what does the one hour trend let us do it helps us decide what lower time frame We are going to scale into to end up looking for a trade Okay, so we're going to look at the hourly trend if If the one hour trend is in line with the four hour trends We're looking at the one hour trend and if we see boom the four hours bullish and the hour lease bullish bet We can scale down into the five minute and look for execution points within there Okay, we cool if If If the one hour is in an opposite okay, I'm going to change this to opposite If If the one hour trend if the one hour trend is in an opposite trend then the four hour trend Then we have to execute on a higher time frame aka the 15 minute. Okay, so if the four hours bullish in the hour In the hourly is bearish What do we get to do we get to scale down onto the 15 minute time frame and then look for execution points Cool cool. We just laid out how we find our daily bias and then how we're going to scale down Simple simple simple and again, this is the simple baby ass shit You're probably going to be like TTR. I only found fucking one trade this week It probably hit take profit If you're going to follow this step-by-step rule by rule If you don't follow this step-by-step rule by rule you'll find 20 trades and be on that normal fucking spectrum I love freedom of speech Okay step six Okay Remember four hour if it's bullish Cool, we know that we're looking for buys We're bullish for the day and then if the one hour is bullish cool We're still bullish we get to scale down into the five minute time frame and looks look for execution points Reverse if the four hour is bullish and the hourly is bearish What does that make us still bullish higher time frame multi-hour power Where where can we execute down to the 15 minute time frame? Okay, we need higher time frame execution points higher time frame confirmation Uh cool cool From there what What are our x Cution points What are our execution points? Well What do we always most often look for when trying to take a trade First things first Where's the top of a trend going to reverse from liquidity sweet and what is something that we know about pretty much the majority of the time every single market open There's going to be liquidity sweet Okay, so our execution points are going to be as so We're going to How should we do this we're gonna go a That was a one a liquidity liquidity sweet Plus break of structure What are we looking for a liquidity sweep On a higher time frame not on the 15 minute not on the five minute. Okay, we want to see it on the high time frame So what does that mean for us what are our higher time frames? What are we only looking at one hour and four hour boom so liquidity sweep One hour Four hour draws of liquidity Okay, and break of structure on Five minute or Okay, so step one we understand our bias. Okay, whatever the four hours telling us That's what our bias is From there if we have a bullish bias, what are we looking for? We're looking for draws of liquidity underneath lows On the high time frames on the four hour and the one hour. Okay, so if we're bullish We're looking for one hour lows and four hour lows We're marking those out the next step within that If if we get into those draws of liquidity once we see those levels hit if we don't see those levels hit nothing happens The way I teach my mastermind students. I say find the four-hour trend If we if we're bullish cool, we highlight the high time frame Lows we get our hands and we shove them into our ass and we don't do anything Until those prices are hit Once they're hit we can scale and into either the five minute or the 15 minute based on both the four hour and the one hour trends Right, so if the four hour is bullish and the hour release bullish Then we get a sweep of lows on either the one hour or the four hour cool We scale that into the five minute time frame and the next thing we're looking for is a break of shush If the four hour is bullish and the hourly is bearish What are we looking for? We're still looking for lows and we can still use both the hourly lows and four hour lows Draws of liquidity doesn't change based on the trend. Okay, so if we're bullish on the four hour But we're bearish on the hourly we're still looking for lows. We highlight every single low That's based on the hourly and the four hour chart. We put our hands on our ass until those prices get hit Cool, we wait we see those prices get hit when where can we scale down into the 15 minute time frame What are we looking for following that a 15 minute break of structure? Cool cool moving forward step b again Once both of these have Once both leaves have happened we're looking for a third confluence Okay What are our what is whatever the other confluence is that we have Order block fair value gap breaker block equilibrium those four okay Damn Okay Okay now let's break this down again Four hours bullish hourly's bullish boom hands in our ass We know that we're waiting for lows to be swept we see a one hour low get swept perfect Muddy hands out boom we can scale down to the five minute because the four hour and the hourly are in line from there We wait for a five minute break of structure Boom what do we move down to then the last and final step we're waiting for our third confluence We're waiting for either an order block to get hit a fair value gap to get hit a breaker block to get hit or equilibrium to get hit Okay We don't do anything until these bitches get hit we don't even do anything once they're hit We need one more step Pause this right here okay moving forward if the four hours bullish but the hourly is bearish We are waiting for a high time frame liquidity sweep still to the downside because the four hours bullish We're waiting for either hourly lows to get swept or four hours lows to get swept our hands are in our ass until that happens We see those lows get swept muddy hands come out 15-minute time frame scaled down we're waiting for a 15-minute breaker structure From there we're looking for our third confluence We're either looking for an order block on the 15-minute for a value gap on the 15-minute breaker block on the 15-minute We're equal equilibrium on the 15-minute Cool cool Last and final step We need to see buying pressure or selling pressure in order to execute out of these Confluence is right because if we just enter right when they get hit How the fuck do we know if they actually held right if we think back to breaker blocks Remember how are these breaker blocks even formed? It's off a consequences Confluence getting invalidated because it just gets blown through We don't want to end up being fucking busted through like a fucking breaker block We want to wait for our confluence to get hit and then buying pressure out or selling pressure out in order to execute Okay, so what does that look like? Literally just a green candle up and out of the order block a green candle up and out of the fair value gap A green candle up and out of the breaker block a green candle closing above equilibrium okay or a Red candle closing underneath in order block red candle closing underneath the fair value gap red candle closing underneath the breaker block or red Candle closing underneath equilibrium Okay, so we need to see buying our selling pressure out of these confluence is in Tomorrow when we go into actually pointing this shit out on the chart I know this is a lot to write down. I the gold today. We're already 22 minutes and 22 minutes into this bitch. I just want you guys to write this down so we can get our strategy down And again, this is the simple shit. There's another piece that we're going to add on to this after But right now this is all we're going to get Okay, last and final ABCDE Okay I Want to see pressure executed? We are going to get into take profits. We're going to get into stop losses Once we start adding more and more stuff. Okay, all I want for you guys today is to understand this. Okay, this is how we find our overall daily bias Right, we're looking for the four-hour trend in the one-hour trend. That's how we figure out what time frame from we're going to scale down into Okay, from there we figure out our execution points. Okay We understand that we're looking for liquidity suite. Okay, and again, again, this is the simplest shit We're going to add more to this and we're going to add different things that we can change within this As things happen whether it happens during pre-market or post-market. Okay, but again, but Ooh forget about that shit Right now this is all I want you to guys to know because this is the simplest fucking strategy We did this with my mastermind my first mastermind and all of them literally like Just by being disciplined using risk management and executing purely based off these steps alone Don't do anything else besides these steps and you will be successful I promise you no matter fucking what I guarantee you will be successful within the markets How many trades will you take? I don't fucking know it's not going to be a lot But you will you will win more trades than you lose if you follow this shit work for work bar for bar A lot of you guys are going to get into the market and then try this shit And you're going to take 10 trades in a single day and you're doing it wrong I I haven't taken I haven't seen a single trade using this strategy the past two weeks Okay, so if that gives you any sort of idea of like how simple and how basic this is but also it's really fucking effective This is like the most beginner the most simple ass shit And I mean and again, we're going to add a lot more onto this afterwards Okay, but right now this is the basic shit that I need you guys to understand right this shit down This is your first This is like the fucking base of your strategy you guys can't understand this. I don't know what you're gonna do This is This is like just I learned this today. This is like a regular clock And then we're going to add an 18 fucking barrel attachment and then a switch and then a fucking flashlight and then a red dot and then a fucking beam on that bitch And then we're gonna be lethal killers But right now we just have the fucking base of the shit and that's what this is Cool and because you guys learn this I don't want to see any of you guys taking fucking trades On Monday because you guys still don't know shit We haven't even talked about how we can identify all of these things together We just had to break this down just to explain this shit for you guys tomorrow. We are going to talk about Where that even lies and how to understand where the fuck it is on the chart. Okay cool got it awesome All right guys welcome to strategy creation part number Two so as you guys remember This is how we start looking into our trades, okay? This is kind of our step by step plan our base foundation of how we're going to start looking into trades So now that we understand this we're going to go into identifying these on the chart and as you guys know I pretty much told you guys hey The past two weeks Using this there wasn't even a trade to take so with that big said we kind of have to go back two weeks in order to start identifying this and again It's not an issue because as we start adding on to this you're going to start seeing that hey there's a potential trade to take Almost every single day not with just Wow booger came out because I got so aggressive with you guys Oh Not with just this But with the other things that we're able to add on to this Okay, that's how we're going to start finding more and more trades But for now with just this basic ass simple ass strategy literally square one new Territory this is all that we can do for now, okay? Because again you guys don't know anything about trading You guys don't even know how to enter a trade you guys don't know where to put your stop loss you guys don't know where to put your take profit We're going to get there in part three probably but right now let's just talk about identifying these okay Let's go back like two freaking weeks Let's go back in here Okay, this seems like a decent spot first of all we're only trading New York session Okay, so we're actually just gonna go And here it starts just highlighting every New York session From here I went out. I know there's like an indicator that you can put on that shows New York open but Me personally It's kind of like weird to do that if you ask me How move that one later I need to keep in mind that some of these were high impact news days But regardless we're just gonna walk through It's many of these as possible Oh, okay, cool You Which one was the one that said I know this one But okay, we're gonna start right here. It's going to the four-hour Start off remember what are we looking for Prior to Market open, okay, we're looking at the overall bias of market, okay? So right here we got a breaking structure to the downside on the four-hour price continues lower, okay boom Right we don't know that this four-hour candles going to close bullish until Like 30 minutes into market open so we just need to keep that in mind, okay? So for the time being Price is bearish Okay, on the four-hour. So what are we looking for we're looking for sales scaled down into the hour Okay, on the hourly time frame again, we do not understand that price is going to be bearish Until we see boom this hourly candle close Which is 30 minutes into market open, okay? So for the time being we're still bearish, okay? So we're bearish on both the four-hour And the hourly, okay, because we never see a break of the structure to the upside on the hourly We see this breaker structure to the downside, okay? This is the high. This is the high This is the high we don't see a breaker structure until market open Okay, so with that being said we can scale down into the five-minute time frame not the 15-minute the five-minute because we know hey The hour or sorry, let's stay on the hourly for a bit the hourly time frame and the four-hour are bearish Okay from there. What are we doing? During pre-market we're marking out highs right we want us identify our high time frame draws of liquidity Okay, so boom we're marking out one-hour highs and four-hour highs Okay, boom Okay, prices probably not going to go all the way up into that four-hour high all the way up there All right, okay, we scale into the five-minute time frame Okay, boom market opens What do we see we price we see price draw into these hourly highs? Okay, we have this hourly high all the way up Up here that doesn't get hit we see price drawn to these hourly highs. What are we looking for boom? We can pull our muddy hands out of our ass after these high time frame draws We could did he get hit and we can start looking for a breaker structure on the five-minute time frame Okay From there boom We see a breaker structure to the downside now. What are we looking for we're looking for one of our confluences Okay, where do we see a confluence? Well, there's an imbalance right here Right from this week down to this week. We see it get filled and then boom We see bearish confluence out of that. What else can we identify? Well There's an order block and it starts all the way down here There's a breaker, but it starts right here. So really not much else. We can go ahead and mark out equilibrium if we would like But we really just need one of our We really just need one of our other confluences our continuation confluences To be able to enter because we have what high time frame liquidity sweep We have our four-hour and our hourly in line. We've got our break of structure We're just waiting for that last confluence with rejection to the downside Okay So with that being said we see boom price comes up. We see a break of structure to the downside with this candle right here We see this imbalance get formed. We see price push up into it We see this bearish candle, but what happens remember? I want to see the candle close out of there Okay, so boom we finally see this candle close out of there perfect entry right here Okay, and then from there We're not going to talk about take profits, but we can see That after this entry yeah, we're stuck in a little bit of drawdown with this leg up, but then boom Price floods to the downside Okay, so that's Monday. Let's move over to the next day Start off on the four-hour And again some of these days we probably won't even see trades other days we We might fucking lose trades, okay? But again, like I literally just drew out all these days in a row and we're going to try and get through a lot of these Okay, and again the more we do this the more you guys will see how it works. So Going into Tuesday, okay, this is market open. All right. We see the four-hour is bearish Okay, so what are we looking for we're looking for cells? Why because the four-hour is bearish or buy some bearish based on four-hour Then what do we do we try and see what time frame we can scale down into by looking at the one-hour time frame, okay? So boom we scale in oops we scale into the one-hour time frame This is Monday Tuesday Okay, we scale into the one-hour time frame. What do we see boom prior to Market open we have these hourly lows, okay? We had a break of structure to the upside But then boom prior to market open we see a break of structure to the downside Okay, so what are we we're bearish from both the four-hour and the hourly? So what are we looking to looking towards prior to market open? We're looking for highs within the market right because we're bearish we're looking for high time frame suites So we have an hourly high right here. We have an hourly high right here and Right here and the next hourly highs all the way up here We could also look at the four-hour, but I believe this was a four-hour high From there since the hourly and the four-hour are both bearish we're able to scale into the five-minute time frame Okay, and start looking for trades Okay, we get in here market opens we sweep out one of our high time frame draws on liquidity What can we do pull our hands out of our ass now? What are we waiting for we're looking for a liquidity suite? Or sorry, we already had our liquidity suite. We're waiting for a break of structure to the downside on the five-minute When we get that literally right after boom we break structure to the downside on the five-minute now Let's mark out literally every single one of our conferences this leg up What does that turn into this turns into an order block? I'll go ahead and just turn that into a blue thing this identifies the order block What is this down move prior to that break of structure boom this turns into a breaker? What else can we identify we have boom? This is a fair value gap. We also have this Is a fair value gap? Okay We can go ahead and mark out equilibrium From boom swing high down to swing low. Okay So let's see out of all these confluences which one gets hit did equilibrium get hit on this pullback? Nope Did the order block get hit on the pullback? Nope did the breaker block get hit on the pullback? Nope Did this fair value gap get hit on the pullback? Nope did this fair value gap get hit on the pullback? Yes, it did Okay, we see price get a move up. Okay, we see the imbalance from this week down to this week We see one move up and then we see boom wick right into it and then what we see it closes bearish out of that Okay entry right here on that close And again, I'm going to show you guys how we can get better entries So we're not stuck and draw draw down like this But what do we see? Okay price moves down for a little bit hip hip hooray psych We move up we fill this imbalance in a little bit more Again, we don't know where our stop losses and where our take profits are yet But we see long-term price makes a big move boom 22 ticks to the downside for an awesome bearish move. Okay, that's two days in a row that we crushed it using that strategy Okay, let's move on to Wednesday and see how Wednesday played out And again, this is like not cherry pick. This is literally me walk like This me walking through the shape with you guys Okay, so this was Monday Tuesday Wednesday. Okay, so going into Wednesday What are we we are bearish on the four-hour time frame prior to market open right We have these highs right here. We have these highs right here. We never see a break the structure to the upside till obviously after and during the day But we're bearish on the four-hour. What are we looking for? We're looking for cells? Okay, we go into the hourly time frame. Let's look at the hourly prior to market open Okay, what are we we are bearish right because we see Boom, there's no highs that are being broken Okay, going into Pre-market what are we doing? We're marking out the high time frame draws of liquidity. What are we looking for? We have Boom these hourly highs. We also have boom these hourly highs We also have boom these hourly highs all of these have potential to be draws on liquidity since both the four-hour and the hourly are in line We can scale down into the five-minute To be able to take our confluences and take our trade Okay Let's get into this okay market boom market opens. We see Boom hourly time frame Confluence gets hit hands out of our acts. Okay, what are we looking for break the structure to the downside boom when do we get it? Right after okay now what are we looking for? Okay, let's start labeling our confluences We have an imbalance right here Okay We have this is a breaker block, but price doesn't even get any lower than that So there's no even like retesting this We have this move up as an order block, but again, prices and even underneath there at that point And we can go ahead and mark out equilibrium from these highs down to these lows And we don't see that get hit either So our entry is going to be on this fair value This was a trade that I took and I actually lost on this trade however we'll go over Nasdaq on the same exact day And show you guys how we won on this but continuing Or actually there's no reason to even do that. This is just explanation sake. I don't need to show you as that this should works Okay, we come up we sweep liquidity. We get a break of structure to the downside Okay, we see this imbalance. Okay, we see boom it gets filled. We see boom closure out of that. This is going to be our entry right here Unfortunately for us you probably would have been stopped out. I personally was stopped out on this trade when I took it But we can see That price ends up continuing down making a downwards move And then boom news came out this day price ends up moving higher and higher Okay, and like I was saying on Nasdaq There was a similar trade that ended up hitting take profit I'm pretty sure I put it on like a trade recap somewhere if you guys really want to go over and look at it you guys can't but boom first L using this two wins one loss Okay, let's move forward to Thursday. See if there's any trades to take on Thursday We're grinding through this Monday Tuesday once a Thursday Okay Thursday what are we we are bullish on the four hour and I think if I remember this correctly There were no trades to take on this day Okay, so we're bullish on the four hour why we got a break of structure to the upside right here Boom carrying into market open right we've seen nothing but bulls Okay, go into the hourly timeframe All right, wait there actually wasn't trade today Okay, go into the hourly timeframe Boom we see that we're breaking the structure higher and higher the upside and the hourly timeframe Cool, so we're bullish on both the four hour and hourly timeframe another perfectly aligned High timeframe for us. We've only been able to scale into the five minute We haven't necessarily had one of those 15-minute entries yet. Okay, hopefully we can have an example of that Sometime a lock here. Okay, so boom what are we looking for prior to market open? We're looking for High timeframe lows to sweet because we're bullish right okay, so we have this hourly low We have this hourly low and all the way down here. We have this potential hourly low down here. Okay, what do we do? Scale into the five-minute we're waiting for those confluence is to get hit And then we can pull our hands out of our ass if we end up seeing anything Okay, oh now I remember this one. There's still no trade to take Okay, so on this we see boom market opens We can pull our hands out of our ass because we see that liquidity Had been taken out our high-time frame liquidity is taken out. What do we see after that a break of structure? Boom to the upside now. What are we looking for we're looking for our third confluence? Okay, so boom we have an imbalance right here. We have an imbalance Right here this move down turns into an order block and this move up right here is our breaker Okay, we can also go ahead and mark out equilibrium Um Boom Do we see any of our confluence is hit? No, unfortunately not okay, we don't see the and we don't see equilibrium hit We don't see this imbalance get hit We don't see this order block get hit we don't see this breaker block get hit and we don't see this imbalance get hit Again like I was saying before this I remember this day I was never I was never able to take a trade on ES. I'm pretty sure there was a Good trade on Nasdaq Again, you guys can probably go back and look and see if there actually was in the trade recaps Videos but boom this was an example of a day where there's no trade so be taken all right moving forward Friday of this same week There's a Friday okay Friday what are we on the four-hour we are bullish okay Right we can see rice keep moving higher and higher okay we keep getting break structures the upside We go into the hourly timeframe What are we we are bullish okay where what do we want to mark out we want to mark out our hourly lows okay? We've an hourly low right here We have another hourly low right here. That was actually already swept we have another hourly low right here That's pretty much equal that hourly low so boom. This is really our only hourly low. What are we able to do since the Four-hour and the hourly are bullish we're able to scale into five-minute timeframe. Okay. There's really only one low that we want to be targeting Okay, we see market push all the way down barely miss it and boom, okay? Yeah, you can say oh You know price Came down and swept out liquidity all the way down here cool. We can mark it out just for fuck sake But again like this is this is literally like seconds away from Asian session right we're not gonna be sitting on the charts for How long would that be nine Bra. Yeah, like 11 hours. No, thank you but anyways that we finally see That could hit okay, we get a break structure the upside on the five-minute Okay, I don't even need to mark out the other confluences because market closes like right here, but Again a day where there's no trades to be taken I want to actually there's no reason to even check Okay, it's going to Monday of the next week so this Friday Monday Okay Monday of the next week we are still bullish okay, we don't know that we're going to close to the downside on the four-hour timeframe right here Okay, we are going to be monitoring for hour low four hour lows and hourly lows. Okay, four hour is bullish. Let's go into the hourly Boom the hourly was bullish going into market open right we can see prices moving higher and higher Okay, that being said we're going to go ahead and mark out hourly lows. Okay, so boom. We have this hourly lower here Be this hourly low all the way down here. Okay, and we have this hourly low right here. Okay, what are we able to do since the four-hour and the hourly are in line We're able to scale down into the five-minute timeframe Okay What do we see here? Okay, boom price liquidity gets swept Both of these draws of liquidity get swept Okay, what are we looking for we're looking for a break of shutter boom. We see highs right here Nothing highs right here finally break of shutter right here now. What are we looking for we see the break We're looking for imbalances. Do we see any imbalances? No no imbalances form. Do we see? Okay, we have this Order block Right here Okay, not necessarily Uh the best confluence. Okay, and then we have this breaker block Right here super wide price range Again, what are what are we going to be doing with this not much Okay, and then kind of our last hope we can go ahead and mark out equilibrium From here. Okay, so this is a perfect example of A day that I wouldn't necessarily watch straight Because we can see price comes down. We do get this sweep. We do get a break of shutter But we don't get a fair value gap. We see price push Like all the way down here. We see price chopping around. Yeah, we could technically say okay cool Like if we're beginners and we're just following that Shit step step step step for step bar bar for bar cool Maybe we make a fucking mistake and we want to go along here right But in reality if we're looking at this at this Price action we're probably understanding that okay this sweep and then this break We're already what three hours into market open This isn't necessarily what we're looking for Right, we see price dip all the way down here and then cool we get boom legs up. Let's just say we enter cool damn stopdout Okay, move on to the next day Tuesday Tuesday, okay, so going into Tuesday we are bearish only four hour time frame, okay? Right, we had a break finally had our breaker structure to the downside right here Okay, so we're looking for shorts Okay, we can go ahead and scale into the hourly timeframe. We'll look at the hourly timeframe. We are bullish Okay, on the hourly so what does that make us do That makes us scale into the 15-minute timeframe start looking for conferences This is the first time that we've been able to have this opportunity. Okay, so we're going to go ahead and mark out these highs On the hourly we have these highs and then we have these highs all the way up here Okay, so we're going to scale into the 15-minute See if we see anything, okay? We don't get a sweep of this we see legs down We sweep this and then boom we rally right back up and Again, this is a similar situation to the last time Where it does end up going in our direction, but again is this necessarily a trade that we want to take? Okay, we do see a sweep We do see a breaker structure to the downside on the 15-minute. Okay, we have an imbalance right here We see you get filled we see it close get closed out of cool. Maybe this is our entry Right how would this have played out for us? Probably really fucking well, right we see price Fall Boom 24 ticks And Am is this and again, this is stuff that we're going to be getting into way way down the line as we keep adding to the strategy Talking about times that we want to trade times that we want to avoid trading stop loss take profit as we start adding even more Confluence is tour strategy so we can avoid days like this But for now Right, we're purely just going off of what we know and that's just the basic ass shit Right So cool if we did enter on this fucking w clap it up dub okay But again just talking about like further down the line ideally we don't necessarily want to be taking this trade I'm you guys are getting it now. I'm hoping for at least how to Execute let's see this was Tuesday Wednesday's this last one that we have Wednesday Okay, cool We'll do last one Wednesday, okay, I believe this is when price started getting really ugly anyways So Wednesday we are bearish Okay on the four-hour. I believe yeah, we're moving sideways on the four-hour again not necessarily ideal trading conditions Okay, we are bearish on the bearish on the four-hour Bullish will be hourly or actually we're bearish Prior to market open I believe let's see if this candle yeah, this candle was even so we were bearish on both four-hour and the hourly so what does that let us do that let's have scaled down in five-minute time frame What are we doing we're marking out hourly highs and prior to market open? We didn't even know that this was a high so we're not even going to mark that one out because this down candle Hadn't even been formed yet. So we have this hourly high and we have this hourly high all the way up here What are we able to do scale them in five-minute time frame? Okay price opens we don't get a break in structure to the downside Nothing happens price moves up we chop sideways pretty Like do we want to be trading sideways moving market like this? Not necessarily we also had high impact news at the end of that day Okay Or sorry the the following day. I believe this was CPI um and boom Right we get a consolidating day again. Do we want to be trading a market that only moves a total of 21 ticks within the day probably not we want to be catching training market moves. So no trade take it on this day so Overall hopefully you guys after this little session you guys getting a good you guys got a good understanding of what we're looking for Right we first look at the four-hour time frame we look at the bias based on its trend then from there We scale into the one-hour time frame and that pretty much gives us an overall direction of okay If it's in line with the four-hour bias we're able to scale down to the five-minute if it's not in line We're able to scale down to the 15-minute Following that whatever time frame that we're able to scale down into we're looking for a break of structure followed by a Confluence and then we can execute Cool cool. So that's our basic ass shit There's still a lot more to add on to this to make it a lot better because obviously right what we just walked through It's not necessarily ideal We're not able to catch trades every single day. We're not necessarily getting the best win rate But it's a step in the right direction to be able to have an actual good Solid working strategy and that's what we want to work towards okay, so hopefully this video is helpful Similar to the little text Text text out video that we did for you guys again if you guys haven't written this down Please do screenshot it put it somewhere tape it on your fucking computer because this is going to help you guys a lot After we start adding more and more onto this I didn't leg day today my legs are fucking dying bro Oh, also do you guys want to see this rolls Royce ghost that I made when I was bored? Isn't this kind of gay, but anyway strategy creation numero three we already know our current situation right let's break it down Even though I really don't want to type the shit out again step one four-hour trend what is it that's bias boom to One-hour trend determined What time cheese bro Okay, so four-hour trend deter Determines what the bias is one-hour trend Determines what time frame we're able to scale down to if it's in line with the four-hour we go to the five-minute If it's not in line we go to the 15-minute and then from there three Need High time frame liquidity liquidity sweep either one-hour or Four-hour okay in line with our bias so for four-hour bias as bullish we're looking for lows to be swept if the four-hour bias is bearish We're looking for highs to be swept Okay, and then from there scale to Okay Okay, so right now this is what we have Four-hour trend what's the bias hourly trend determines the bias the hourly trend determines what time frame we can scale down Again, if four-hour in our online we can go to the five-minute if not we can go to the 15-minute from there We're looking for a high time frame liquidity sweep either on either From one-hour highs and lows or four-hour highs and lows we can mark out all of them We don't do anything until those get hit and then from there once those get hit We can scale down to whatever time frame that the one-hour let us scale down to and look for a break of structure Then a third confluence entry Right we see the entry We know that the reaction out of it. It's just like a candle up or a candle down boom Now wait. Yeah, we already showed that okay now We are going to add one more thing before we start talking about stop losses and take profits and then after that We're going to add more things to help us get even better entries. Okay, so for the time being we're not even talking about stop loss take profit we're talking about Another way to Help our entries out and then we can get into stop loss and take profits right after this one, okay? So what are we adding to this? We're adding better ways to enter off of the third confluence so Okay So hopefully this makes sense you guys will show you guys how to identify that But once the third confluence gets hit so let's say the four-hour bias is bullish the hourly bias is bullish cool We can scale down into the five-minute time frame once we get a sweep of hourly lows, okay? So boom, let's say these are hourly lows. We see a sweep We then scale down into five-minute, okay? We see boom a five-minute break-and-structure And then we also see a fair value gap right here When price enters into this fair value gap Before the only way that we were getting confidence was oh buying power out of it with an up candle Cool, we enter off that price goes higher now We're going to be able to get even more into this shit when price gets in here We can scale down into the one-minute time frame and just wait for a one-minute break of structure enter off that Instead of having to wait for a full five-minute candle to close because If the one-minute break structure within this five-minute confluence we can pretty much assume that oh one-minute break of structure That is more than likely going to cause a five-minute bullish candle Okay, same thing to the downsides. Let's say we have boom. This is an hourly high before hours bearish But the hour these bullish Okay, and we get a sweep of this and then we scale down into the 15-minute time frame We see a 15-minute break of structure and price enters into this order block once we get into this order block We can scale into the five-minute time frame and wait for a five-minute break of structure to the downside without having to wait For a full bearish 15-minute candle to enter Cool pretty fucking simple shit on this one just an extra little addition To the law to the step-by-step program that we've already given you guys so far So cool Cool next video is going to be on stop loss and take profit points Okay, should be another pretty easy video, but one more step in the process Yes Bull run I'll see you guys in the next one today. We're going to be talking about I decided we're going to split up stop losses and take profits will just discuss stop losses today stop losses Why are they necessary because we don't want to end up like the fucking Kanye clip and end up being On the spectrum and losing a bunch of our money We want to be on the other side of the spectrum getting paper Getting rich getting bread, okay? So what do stop losses help us do they help us Stay the fuck out of losing a shit ton of money, okay, so stop losses. Why are they important? And how are they useful to us? Well pretty much treat this almost like a confluence ass video, right? so Again Why do we use them why are they important we use them so we don't lose a shit ton of money so we're able to use risk management and Why are they beneficial to us because it's pretty much marking a specific price Where our trade idea is invalidated and we want to exit the market because we were just fucking wrong. So stop losses Why are they useful Right wouldn't say it helps us it makes us Makes us practice risk management. Why do we use them? So we don't lose a shit ton of money and then more Why do this is also on top of that so we don't lose a shit ton of money and because it identifies a price where Our trade idea is invalidated Okay They're useful for us because it helps us practice miss it makes us practice risk management pretty much forces us or for the most part Unless you're like fucking full-porting but and makes us practice risk management because it gives us a set and defined area that we're fully going to get out of the market and then why do we want to use them because we don't want to lose a shit ton of money unless you're an idiot and you're on the other side of the spectrum that Con you talked about and because it helps identify a price where our trade idea is invalidated that's why it's useful That's why we want to apply it ready set fucking break. Let's go to the next video Um where we can no we'll just put it all in one video. I was almost going to blueball you guys like literally just whoa Sorry, I'm not allowed to do that anymore but literally was just like about to like My audience is all male So how am I not supposed to be fruity like trying to explain what blueball like means to you guys anyways? Let's get in here We're just gonna do drawings for now just so you cuz That's all we need to do right now. We're just gonna show it on drawings and then when we get into the other strategy creation videos We can show it on the chart actually identifying these traits out of so for the time being let's go over an example of where we put our stop losses There's a couple places where I typically would like to put my stop loss so Again, we need to think about what's the main use of these I'm burning in this bitch literally sweating my ass off right now So say thank you in the comments Like literally I wish you guys could feel my chest. It's wet right now, okay, but Anyways, let's say we see whatever our liquidity suite break the structure on the lower timeframe We see the third confluence get entered in let's say we're on the five minute. Okay, we see a one minute break of structure boom And let's say we're we were able to enter off like an order block really close to the liquidity suite For me as long as my take profit and we'll get into take profits Tomorrow, okay As long as my take profit with my first area that I'm always going to be looking for for my stop losses going to be over the liquidity suite Why because that that's like without a doubt like if we're taking our trade off of this liquidity suite So we know that the trade idea is completely fucking booth pack. We're on the other side of the spectrum if Price goes above this This sweep right because then it's not a fucking liquidity suite because price keeps going fucking higher Okay, so that's my first area that I would like to put my stop loss Above the liquidity suite if the risk or award doesn't make sense for my first take profit and again We'll talk about that. So let's say my first take profit is like right here and it doesn't make sense Cool, what else am I going to look for well within the confluence? I'll either look for again. This is for bear bearish bias. I'll look at we'll talk about bullish bias next Okay, I'll look for the highs made within the confluence prior to that break of structure to the downside on the lower timeframe Okay, or I'll just look for the highs made within the confluence. I was made so let's say we make a five minute high right here And we're continuing down cool and then we find our entry within the one minute timeframe right here awesome My stop loss is going to be above those highs Cool as long and again This makes it a little bit risky because what happens if price goes up here? Is your trade ID unvalidated Well, not completely Sort of because you thought that price was going to go Lower from here and then it ended up wanting to go a little bit higher taking out these highs, but overall your bias was correct Because you were still able to identify the liquidity sweep so that's where you want to debate with yourself and see Okay, is this worth taking the risk of taking this trade or what I rather just said this one one out based on the risk reward, okay? So again, that's if your take profit is like right here and you have a horrible risk for a ward But you see a five minute high you see the break, okay? And you're like, okay bet now this makes sense because it's a one-to-one cool gets hit Yeah, we're rich not Okay, moving forward This Norton security shit always asked me to restart my computer. Who do you think I am, bro? Okay That's mainly where I like to put my stop losses either above the liquidity sweep again That's going to be our highest confluence like okay boom the liquidity sweep gets taken out bet like word It's said in fucking nut right our trade idea would we're just really shit at this because it was in all liquidity sweep And that's what we were basing our whole fucking trade off of Or we're going to be basing off it often Okay, that confluence area right we see the fair value gap boom would make like a five minute high We get our entry somewhere within here cool another area that I like to Put my stop loss again, maybe my take profit is like right here and The stop loss or Okay, and if in the stop loss doesn't make sense to put it over or sorry And the stop loss if it's going to be above here it's still an insane risk of reward ratio But because of that scary ass shit where price could push higher go to another confluence and Because our risk reward is so good we can give our stop loss a little bit of breathing room So instead of putting it above the high that's made within the confluence We just put it above the confluence itself because what happens if price wants to just push a little deeper into the confluence and then go lower from there Still a possibility happens all the time So those are really like the three Yeah, right those are really like the three levels of Stop loss areas that I like to like to put my stop loss at first and foremost is going to be above or below the liquidity Second is going to be the high that's made within the third confluence Okay, and third is just going to be above the confluence itself right if we have a fair value gap We have a fair value gap price pushes in there makes a high okay, this is a possible spot and then also above there Is a possible spot and again? Why is this better because we could push higher into the confluence and then go lower But again if we push fully past that confluence the trade idea is essentially bunk Because we were trying to take a trade off of this confluence off of this price range Cool and it's going to be the same thing to the upside so Boom we see the liquidity sweep again the most ideal stop loss is going to be underneath these lows because of price comes down here boom were on the spectrum and We didn't identify this liquidity sweep correctly. Okay moving forward If we have a little confluence, I'm fair about how you got right here Okay Second area that we can put our stop loss is going to be right within here. Okay, let's say we find our entry right here We can go ahead and plop our stop loss right there Take profit like Breaking here cool nice, and then remember if our first take profit it gives us a lot of room right a really good risk reward our last Area if we if we want to give our trade potential the war Potential breathing room because we're scared about this being a like super strong confluence, okay? And price potentially do this our third area to put our stop loss is just underneath that Conclunce that we're taking a trade off of because again If price goes down into this like this and then continues higher The trade idea wasn't fucking bunk because it's still used The the confluence that we wanted to take a trade off of right So there's varying levels of risk to this this is pretty much like our best bet underneath the liquidity sweep or over the liquidity sweep Second best bet is going to be underneath or over the confluence and then third best bet is going to be on the higher low made within the confluence Cool and Cool stop losses Explained I'll see you guys in the next one. I appreciate it last video We covered stop losses today. We will be covering take profits should be a relatively easy Day and we're going to use the trade that I took yesterday to help us Identify take profits. So first of all, I just want to sit in front of you guys and have you guys look at my pretty face And also tell you guys the benefit of having take profits besides making fucking money And also a couple different strategies that you guys could use because if you guys don't necessarily have to use my strategy of taking profits And you guys don't even have to be using my trading strategy But you guys are like hey, I need to know where and how to take profits from the market cool this video is for you Let's get into it. So why are take profits beneficial? One it helps us make money within the market and two we need a set Price or a set area for us to be able to just Cash out or take money out of the market because as we know it we're trading on like five fifteen hourly increments Okay, we're trying to catch like one to three hour moves. We're not trying to catch daily moves unless you're a swing trader Again, this is going to vary but whatever timeframe that you're trading on You have to understand we're trading on the five minute timeframe. We can't be setting our take profits Based on like daily draws on liquidity or daily Confluences because there's so much price action Within the five minute timeframe 15 minute hourly and four hour That odds that let me show you guys a chart real quick Which in within each one of these daily candles there's going to be a lot of price action There's going to be a ton of five minute candles, right? There's going to be a ton of 15 minute candles kind of one minute or sorry ton of one minute candle. It's kind of hourly candles and They all make up this big down candle so The reason why I'm telling you guys this is even though if we know where the market wants to go on the daily timeframe We still can't necessarily set our five minute entry Take profit based off of daily levels because Within this daily candle even though we know it probably wants to move down Within the five minute it could go Within the five minute It could go like this it could go up and then we get a move down and then boom right back up Stop us out of break even and then boom right back down and then hope sweep these highs and then go down to make that daily candle To make that daily down candle and even though our overall bias was correct like hey We know the daily timeframe it wants to go down. It's probably seeking out the strong liquidity That's we can't base our take profits based off in that high of a timeframe while executing on that low of a timeframe So I want you guys to keep that in mind First of all when placing your take profits along with that how our take profits beneficial Again, we can't be over ambitious. We can't be greedy and we can't keep extending our take profits So it literally marks that's why stop losses and take profits are so important it literally marks the areas where we say okay Price hit a price point where price could potentially reverse off of and go back in the other direction For me personally, I don't like setting take profits based off of Like random shit like oh, it's five ticks to the downsides. I'm going to take my profit That's okay. That's how you guys operate and that's how you guys take profit. That's a take profit strategy cool I'm just not going to teach you guys that there because for me I like to do everything based off of common sense even though it seems like I have done sometimes Okay, I like to take profits based on probable areas where if price hits that area within my current bias Right, let's say I take a short if it hits this area there is potential that once that area gets hit price could reverse and end up taking out my trade Okay So again, that's why I set multiple take profits so I can let my runners run and that's also why we have a firm set stop loss because If again, that's why I don't like saying oh, I have five tick stop loss I would much rather place my stop loss Above an area that invalidates my trade idea so price goes up and hits a certain price point and invalidates my trade idea Then Jeez, bro Okay, it's gone if price hits that price point then it's pretty much saying look my Trade idea was wrong versus if I just place a short no stop loss no take profit And we're just thinking oh price is gonna go down Where's our invalidation points where is the point where okay? This trade idea is no longer valid Where is a point where we want to exit the trade and say boom? Congratulations, you fucking killed it you predicted where price wanted to go So that's why number one a huge rule about taking profits never extend your take profits never move your take profits Once you set your stop loss in your take profit don't fucking move it don't fucking change it leave it there Okay, because emotions can come into play especially a lot of you guys you guys are emotionally affected by the market There's no reason to be moving your stop loss and there's no reason for you guys to be moving your take profit Just place the trade and so what if you guys lose cool to learning experience That you guys lost a trade if anything that's good for you guys so you can figure out what the fuck you did wrong versus if you guys keep Extending your stop loss keep extending your take profit then you don't even know why you place the trade in the first place Because now your invalidation point is much higher and your take profit point is much lower and Then you won't even know why you lost a trade or why you won the trade because who knows what could have happened if it hit that Invalidation point or if it that take the original take profit that you guys said cool so It's getting to take profits now into the chart I like to take profits based on high confluence areas where price could potentially reverse Based off that current trade idea so we'll use The trade that I took today or yesterday As an example so I took shorts on the five minute time frame Okay, I had three take profits on this one two and three okay And why did I have these three take profits? well they were hourly draws on liquidity and They were four hour draws on liquidity So with that in mind I'm thinking okay at this current time The the daily timeframe is bullish and if it wants to continue being bullish Again that's in the back of my mind even though my bias was short which is okay because the daily timeframe was bullish the four hours bearish and hourly was bearish I was okay taking shorts Even though The daily was bullish I have to keep that in the back of my head because I know okay this four hour low this hourly low This four hour order block Could potentially cause the daily timeframe As we come into these levels To continue bullish and to push higher even though my bias on the five minute Was bearish and even though I took this trade to the downside Okay, so I exited half of my position here another half of my open position here and then I closed the rest of my remaining position here and Crushed this trade Versus if I had just left this open ended let's say I didn't even have this here Yeah price probably like I would have made fucking bank But what would have happened if price came down here and I'm like oh it's going to keep going lower and then boom The daily timeframe continues higher. That's why we need to take profits Okay, so Now with that in mind let's just go in and list Take profit points Okay And our take profit points are actually going to be our confluence is why Because keep in mind Even though we're taking trades to the downside where do we where would we likely want to take take profits Where price could potentially reverse back up to the upside Based off of our regular trade confluence is right because these are confluence is for price to potentially Give us a trade entry even though we're not trying to take longs off of these points We're trying to exit our cell positions Okay, and obviously the inverse is applicable as well. So where do we like where do we want to take profit off of draws on liquidity order blocks Fair value gaps Breakers And sometimes even equilibrium This is where we can take profit off of just previous confluences and typically what I like to do is I like to take The confluence is on the high time frame. So again for me I find my bias based on the four hour and the one hour So where am I likely going to set my take profits on the four hour and on the one hour based on certain confluences? So like you guys saw What's happening on this trade My take profit points were based off of hourly liquidity here hourly liquidity here and a four hour order block right here boom simple simple Just that's that's as simple as it is because again remember guys what are we trying to do when we enter into a trade right? Let's let's just do this whole trade recap over yet The four hour was bearish the hourly was bearish where was I looking for a trade? Okay, we saw I'll kind of speak through this Five-minute break of structure after sweeping these five-minute highs. We filled in this fair value gap We saw one minute break of structure I entered off that stops above the stops above the fair value gap Okay Where am I looking to potentially exit and how will this how will this trade complete my bias for the day? Well, we know it wants to go down and we know the four hour and the hourly are saying yeah It's likely going to go down but where did the four hour and the hourly also reverse off of hourly liquidity four hour liquidity in a four hour order block. So that's where we set our take profits Okay, you can For the most part, I don't really like taking profits on the 15-minute or the five-minute Setting it based off these if there's no like hourly or four hour Confluences four take profit points then I'll scale down into the 15-minute and try and find like 15-minute liquidity But most of the time you will be able to find these Confluences to be able to take profits and to be able to secure profits from the market From your trade, okay? So with that in mind we just covered stop losses We just hope cover take profits. We are going to be talking about Even more strategy creation how we can amplify our strategy because for the time being I need to go back and check in on the strategy creation Part three For the time being I'm pretty sure we have pretty limited amount of strategy for us to be taking trades which is good right now because right now again the whole point of this is to build your guys's base Okay, and then scale it up until you guys have no great pyramid of geese off. Okay. Wow. No no aluminum Addy I didn't eat that wasn't like a sign or anything. I'm didn't Okay, anyways. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Peace out. I love you guys. Welcome to strategy creation strategy creation part four so Right now our strategy consists of this four hour bias based on the trend one hour determines what time frame We can scale into to take trades, okay? If in line with oops with four hour five minute if not we go to the 15 minute Okay from there let's put this here and then from there We scale into whatever lower time frame LTF scale into lower time frame Look for high time frame liquidity sweep Okay, so either on the one hour or the four hour and then from there scale into lower time frame look for break of structure and a third Confluence and then from there we can scale down lower time frame If we were on five minute we can go into one minute 15 minute to five minute and find a break after entering into the third Confluence and I'll just Get a little return right here Okay, so right now it looks like this we find the four hour bias we see oh the four hours bullish cool cool our overall Overall bias for the day Is going to be bullish from there we scale into the one hour time frame and we see what's the one hour bias Okay, and that determines what time frame we can scale into to take the trades So if the one hour time frame is in line with four hours So let's say the four hours bullish and the hourly's bullish cool We can scale into the five minute time frame if the four hours bullish and the hourly is bearish We scale into the 15 minute time frame from there We go into the lower time frames and we look for a high time frame liquidity suite Okay, so we're looking for liquidity on both the hourly and the four hour From there we're not doing anything until that liquidity gets hit Once it gets hit we can scale into the lower time frame and look for a break of structure Uh look for a break break of structure again if the four hour and hourly are in line We're going to the five minute if the four hour and the hourly aren't in line. We're going to the 15 minute Looking for a break of structure and then a third confluence Okay, so that could be boom break of structure and then we have an order block And we're looking for a third confluence to get entered it once the third Booh once the third confluence gets pushed into if we're on the five minute We can scale into the one minute and try and find a break of structure within there Okay, and enter off that if we're on the 15 minute and it's entering into a 15 minute third confluence We can scale into the five minute and find a break of structure right there That's the strategy that we have so far Okay, so I would like to add to this now This is pretty this is what we have right now and this is to wait for a liquidity sweep Right when market opens sometimes that's not the case and sometimes there's a liquidity sweep before market opens So what we are going to add to this Is going to be If we see during pre-market a liquidity sweep And then a break to the downside Okay First first thing that we want to do still identify the four-hour bias okay And if the four-hour bias is bearish Okay, let's say look here let's say the four-hour bias is bearish and We recently broke structure on the four-hour But up here during pre-market we saw an hourly liquidity sweep in a break of structure You're probably thinking well, there's probably not going to be another liquidity sweep So what are we supposed to do off this That's when we start looking for the hourly confluences So what happens when we get an hourly sweep in a break of structure the downside We form order blocks on the hourly we form breakers on the hourly we form fair value gaps on the hourly We form equilibrium on the hourly And from there we treat these confluences as our high-time frame sweeps because the high-time frame sweep has already happened During pre-market or maybe during London session whatever And market is already moving in the direction that I want to go Right, which is what the original strategy is based off of trying to find the start of a move right trying to enter up here What happens if this is already happened Well, we can still we can still trade the continuation of that hourly trend And that's what we're going to talk about today. So On top of that if we see a hourly or a four-hour liquidity sweep We're still going to follow this We look at the four-hour bias and we look at the hourly bias, but If we already see a sweep have happened Has happened and I mean like just recently like Let's see if I can find an example of this Okay, let's let's use this as an example. Okay, let's say that this is a market open Okay, and we sweep out these highs Okay, and hypothetically let's just say that the four-hour is bearish and the hourly we see a sweep of these highs and then a break of structure And let's say like right here is market open Obviously we already see the sweep and we know that our biases bearish And the hourly bias is bearish, but we're saying hey odds that We're going to if the hourly and the four-hour bias is bearish What are the odds that this is the only high that we have currently? Let's say that like this is price action. This is the high that has to be swept you're probably thinking oh We can't even take a trade today. Well, no, that's when this addition to the strategy comes into play That's when we can say hey look there's a fair value gap on the hourly there's a Order block I can't even see yeah, boom. There's an order block on the hourly right here Okay, there's a breaker right here on the hourly Okay, and from there We use these confluences getting entered in similar To the liquidity sweep happening So if we already see a liquidity sweep happen and like a break on the hourly Then what can we do we can target hourly confluences? So let's say price enters into a fair value gap market opens What are we going to do if the four-hour bias is bearish the hourly bias is bearish and we enter into an hourly fair value gap after a liquidity sweep has already happened We're able to scale down into the five-minute And all that we're looking for is a five-minute break of structure And then our third confluence and then we just continue on so we see a five-minute break of structure Boom five-minute fair value gap scale into the one-minute look for a one-minute break of structure enter off that stops above the highs Target again, we already talked about targets yesterday Higher time frame draws on liquidity higher time frame confluences And that's all that today is we're just adding that little Piece of strategy with liquidity sweep so let's talk about how it would work in the opposite direction Okay, so let's say and with the four-hour and the hourly not in line So let's say boom the four-hour is bullish and The hourly we see a liquidity sweep to the downside and then a break of structure the upside Okay, and then boom we see an hourly We see an hourly Confluence Right here a fair value gap or fuck it. Let's say order block. Okay. This is our order block And we see price drawing to this hourly order block and then boom market opens This is our market open. We already saw a pre-market sweep We already see saw the sweep happen. So the odds that a liquidity sweep is going to happen or low Okay Again Something that I want you guys to keep in mind always be open to again like our our best and most awesome confluence is going to be liquidity sweep so Obviously we're going to want to look for a liquidity sweep, but there's going to be obvious times like This day for example like we're already so far gone like let's say this was market open right here You really think that price is going to come all the way up here and give us a trade entry to be able to sweep this liquidity because the four-hour was bearish the hourly was bearish But you think prices just gonna make and then go to no So what would we have to playoff of hourly fair value gap Boom we see it enter into an hourly fair value gap. We can just use this for an example Okay, we scale into our lower time frame Where's the break of structure we see a move down then a move up Move down then move up right here boom. We break structure on this candle Cool Cool, what else do we have we have a fair value gap within here? We see price push into the fair value gap cool Let's scale down into the one-minute time frame Even again like this is some bullshit. This was like during Asian session or something, but this is just uh Show you guys how we're boom. We get a break of structure right here move up or sorry move down then to move up okay We see price break structure cool enter off that boom Okay, we can target Higher time frame draws on liquidity all the way down here cool cool That's how we would look at it Okay, let's talk about the upside and then we can wrap this up because this is just another addition to our strategy And again, there's going to be even more additions to this To help you guys find a bunch of trades because right now you guys probably aren't finding many trades Okay, and that was the point we just want to start building on top of our foundation Okay, so boom let's say this happens in pre-market Okay, we have this order block price enters into the order order block Boom, let's say market open like right here. We see price dipping down entering to this hourly order block The four hours bullish the hour these bullish cool We know that we want to go long What are we waiting for? We're waiting for a five-minute break of structure the upside because we moved down We probably had to break five-minute structure to the downside to be able to fill in this order block right because it's going to be an hourly retrace We wait for a five-minute confirmation break of structure out of that We wait for our five-minute third confluence. Okay, whether it be a fair value gap Whether it be an order block on the five-minute whether it be equilibrium We see price pushing there and either we wait for that five-minute move up or one minute break of structure Boom we enter off of that Stopse the underneath the fair value gap underneath these lows to play it safe And then we can target previous hourly highs or four-hour highs or hourly confluences or four-hour confluences to take our trade Let's get going all right. We are going to add on to our strategy today Let's get up and let's get popping so I shouldn't have to do much of a recap of what we already know within our strategy But today we're going to add a little bit more on how we can actually take more trades without just a liquidity sweep happening During pre-market just a liquidity sweep happening right when market opens. Okay, so step one What are we looking for? We're looking for a four-hour bias slash trend to determine what our bias for the day is going to be Step two look at the one-hour. Okay trend And bias slash trend that helps us What lower To scale into okay, that helps us determine what lower time frame to scale into when our bigger confluences get hit And today we are going to be talking about Extra or I guess other high time frame confluences other than a liquidity sweep that can help us take take take trades Okay, so moving on from there when our high time frame Confluences get hit we scale and Jeez scale scale into lower time frame And then four okay wait for lower time frame break of structure Five wait for lower time frame third confluence whether that's a fair value gap order block breaker block equilibrium okay, and then six wait for either smaller lower time frame break of structure or Up slash down candle on the current lower time frame out of the third confluence boom boom, boom, boom, boom, okay So that's what we have so far Right, this is how we're taking trades Okay, and the only thing that changes here is number three number three it originally was wait for a higher time frame liquidity sweep whether it's on the four hour or the one hour Okay, and again the one-hour time frame it helps us determine whether we're scaling into the five minute or the 15 minute To look for that break of structure and to look for that third confluence. We all know that right So Today we're going to talk about higher time frame confluence is other than liquidity sweeps that can help us Enter in off of trades, okay, and this should be pretty freaking simple should should be pretty freaking easy to add into our arsenal, okay? So let's say We are in geez wait this mouse is moving a little bit to whoa Okay Okay, let's say we are in an uptrend on the four hour and Let's say we're in a downtrend on the hourly so From our current strategy that we know if we're in an uptrend on the four hour our buys is going to be bullish We're going to be looking for longs and the main thing that we're looking for is either going to be a four-hour break of structure or sorry A four-hour liquidity sweep or an hourly liquidity sweep to the downside 15-minute break of structure 15-minute third confluence either wait for a five-minute break of structure after that third confluence Or just a 15-minute candle to the upside in order to execute Right now with the new additions that we're putting in we won't have to wait for an hourly liquidity sweep It's still a possible confluence that we can take a tradeoff of however now we're going to add in four-hour confluencees so let's say We have a four-hour order block or a four-hour breaker or a four-hour fair value gap in the hourly timeframe pushes into them Okay That is still a high-time frame confluence that we are able to scale down into once it gets hit Even if we don't get a liquidity sweep on the hourly we can scale into the 15-minute time frame once we get into these four-hour confluencees Okay, and we can see Does the 15-minute give me a break of structure? Does the 15-minute give me that third confluence filled? Does the five-minute give a break of structure after that third confluence gets filled? Boom execute. That's all that we're doing Okay, so on top of high-time frame liquidity sweeps we're adding in high-time frame confluencees Okay, and how I want you guys to look at this would be if the four-hour is At not in line with the hourly so let's say the four hours in an uptrend and the hourleas in a downtrend We're going to be looking for four-hour confluencees. Okay, so four-hour fair value gaps four-hour order blocks four-hour breaker blocks Four-hour equilibrium we can look for price draw in there and then once that gets hit We can scale into the 15-minute as if we saw a high-time frame liquidity sweep again We're not ruling out high-time frame liquidity sweeps. We those are still extremely valid We're just adding another piece to this. Okay, so within this high-time frame confluencees What is that involved that involves liquidity sweeps that involves four-hour order blocks that includes four-hour fair value gaps That includes four-hour breaker blocks equilibrium all of that Okay, so that's when the four-hour is in an uptrend and the hourleas in a downtrend Okay, same situation as all of this except instead of just waiting for a liquidity sweep We are able to use four-hour confluencees now what happens if we are in an uptrend On the four-hour and an uptrend on the hourlead well Again, just like here We don't necessarily have to wait for an hourlea liquidity sweep or a four-hour liquidity sweep to scale into the five-minute Now when both both the four-hour and the hourlea are in line We can look for hourly fair value gaps hourly order blocks hourly breaker blocks For price of draw into and then when we get in there we can look for a five-minute break of structure five-minute third confluence fill either a one-minute break of structure out of that third confluence or just a five-minute candle to the upside and execute boom So all that we added today is going to be The ability to take trades off of not only liquidity sweeps, but also Higher time frame confluencees while still literally keeping that same systematic strategy that we already have So our high time frame confluencees are again still high time frame liquidity sweeps But now we have high time frame fair value gaps high time frame Order blocks high time frame breaker blocks high time frame equilibrium And when those get hit we can scale down into our lower time frame wait for that lower time frame break of structure Wait for that lower time frame third confluence Wait for that either smaller time frame break of structure Okay, or just an up or down candle on the current lower time frame out of the third confluence Okay, so again, we'll we'll show this one more time with a downtrends And let's say we're in a four-hour downtrend and the one hour is in an uptrend Okay, since the four hour and the hourlea are Opposing okay, and the four hours in a downtrend we want to be taking shorts Okay, let's say there's a four-hour fair value gap right here and price already drew into it Let's say we don't end up sweeping hourly liquidity to the upside to cause us to look for shorts We can simply look for a 15-minute break of structure a fill of a third confluence on the 15 minute because we're within A four-hour confluence okay to look for price move lower Okay, and then one more time if we're in a downtrend on the four-hour and the hourlease in a downtrend we can simply look for hourly confluence Okay, if we're price of push into an hourly fair value gap and again possible hourly liquidity suite possible for hour liquidity suite possible hourly break a breaker block possibly possibly an hourly order block For us to scale into the five-minute get a break of structure to the downside look for that third confluence And then either look for a one-minute break of structure To the downside or just wait for a five-minute down candle for us to execute cool cool Perfect we're adding to the strategy. Hopefully this helps you guys um, I Guess give give you guys more setups throughout the day And throughout their trading day because originally it started off with us just being able to take trades Clearly off of liquidity suede so we don't necessarily want that okay, we want to be able to take trades For the most part whenever price gives us a high probability setup and we are just adding onto that today So that being said I appreciate you guys. Thank you guys for sticking with me. All right. Peace out boys I've given a lot of sauce out on here for free her fucking usual to you guys Mainly focused on like futures and indexes, but um, I know a lot of you guys are forex traders as well So I wanted to start going into an old forex strategy that I used to use um the strategy that I teach in the trading transformation in the boot camp It's still applicable to forex. I just kind of wanted to go into a forex specific strategy um I've never used it on indexes and I honestly don't think it would apply that well because this utilizes every single session for Forex okay, so yeah, I kind of want to get into a forex strategy to help you guys out with that to be able to help you guys Make a shit ton of money Intrating for free because that's uh what I came here to do. It's my purpose for y'all I really want to turn all you guys profitable. So without further ado, let me pull up I forex chart. I know you guys can't see the chart right now, but I'll go ahead and pull up KBP JPY because this was My favorite pair when I traded forex back in the day Okay, so the first thing that you're going to need to do um is mark out session opens Okay, and if you guys have no clue when sessions open the best thing that you guys can do is go to baby pips Sush oh yeah, mark it out bo Okay, so this shows it for my time and putter eco I'm going to change it to new york time which is actually the same fun time But that's what my timeframe is set to For you guys it depends on what pair you're trading It's probably best if you just have this shit set to new york time um because it'll be in line with the indexes and Yeah, okay, so boom we can go ahead and see When all of these sessions open and that's the first step of this strategy Okay, so we want to be able to mark out every session open and we're actually going to ignore Australian session okay, so we're mainly going to focus on agent session London session in new york session So if we go over here, we know that new york session opens at 8 a.m Okay, so we can go ahead and mark out eight a.m. Right here boom Okay, and then London session opens at three a.m So we can go ahead and find three boom right here And then agent session opens at eight p.m So we can go ahead and mark that out What is a p.m. That's 20 Okay Boom okay, so these are the numbers that we want oops, this should be at eight three 20 Perfect okay, so this is agent session London session and then boom New York session just started all right We're going to want to mark out these consistently On our chart Okay Boom Okay So how the strategy goes and I'm sure you guys have seen this in like videos before um but What I like to do is I will mark out the session highs in the session lows and This is a little bit different than just marking out draws on liquidity because it's just We're Rewind itself we're marking out the session highs and session lows and it's a little bit different than just marking out like liquidity Because most of the time with liquidity we're just marking every single high and fucking low But with this I'm marking out the session highs and session lows and on top of that I like to do it on the 30 minute and for whatever reason this just came with fucking market experience Don't ask me fucking why but Based on my experience doing it this way works okay going in on the 30 minute and what I like to do is I like to take We see where the session highs and the lows are right we can see that these are the session lows and I like to take a little box And draw it out like this from the base of the candle down to the low and then from the base of the candle Up to the high Okay, and those are kind of our Are good to go air it is Okay, and from there What I'd like to do is I like to go And look at overall market sentiment. Okay figure out like all right Right now price is in relative uptrend. Okay, we have a pretty strong highs up here But we're in a relatively strong uptrend especially within The hourly right we just saw price come down sweep out these lows big strong move up. Okay, for me That's giving me an overall bullish sentiment Okay, and what I want you guys to think about and we're not going to go into executions yet today. We're just going to show Kind of how this works Okay What the strategies based off of it's based off of sweeps of Session highs and session lows and then just taking a trade Back down to session highs and lows. So we're using session highs and lows as I guess you could fucking call it like support and resistance um Which I don't necessarily I'm not a fucking support and resistance trader But I guess you could fucking call it that but for me I'm more I'm more see this as like liquidity sweeps of session highs And of session lows and then all that we're doing is taking trades um To the next draw. So what I like to do is I like to mark out every single session session open and then I like to mark out All the session highs and lows Okay, so for this Right here and this is a perfect example of Kind of the stuff that we're looking for Okay, so I'm just going to Remove this really quick and show you exactly what I mean and how this works So we have this is the start of New York session Okay New York creates these session lows. Okay, we could technically drag this all the way down here if we wanted to but I'm just going to drag it out to these lows right here Okay, and then we have these as New York highs Okay, we see what is this Asian session Open and price isn't really doing much It's just kind of bouncing around and then it drives into the base of these candles down into again We can put a freaking line here if we want Drives into these session lows and then we see This Low-key act as a liquidity sweep taking out these lows and then we see a five-minute break of structure and then from there Where do we see price go up and target previous session highs Okay, so that's pretty much all that I want you guys to gather from this video is identifying how And What I want you guys to practice is literally just going in marking out all these session sessions opens and closes Okay, and we can even see here. What is this session? This is London session These are London session lows Okay, we come through And we sweep out London session lows and then these are technically London session highs right because what is a high consist of a move up Then it moved down If we put on London session highs we can see that if we were able to catch the bottom of this wick or find an execution within here We would have hit take profit During this New York session and then from there if we had gone long off of this up to these highs We would have hit take profit on that as well Okay, let's see if we can find any more examples of this But all that I want you guys to do Wait, that should be 20 Okay, so where are New York lows Right here What do we see Asian session do we push into New York lows and then where does price drive Boom Previous New York highs Pretty fucking crazy and then New York highs get hit we come down sweep London session lows come back into London session highs Okay, Asian session opens. What do we do? We sweep out New York session lows push into New York session highs Okay, now we have London session lows right here And London session highs right here And it'll be really interesting to see how this plays out. Well, honestly we can circle back to this in the next video But what I want you guys to do is just get used to marking out Sessions open session opens and closes and just seeing how price Bra, this shit is so fucking hard. Look at this shit Okay, so we have this as our London session low London session high New York opens Above London session highs we drive into London session lows revisit London session highs I just want you guys to mark out session opens and see and mark out the highs and lows on the 30-minute time frame like I told you guys to And see how often this plays out. It's not going to happen every single time But it's broad did I miss oh yeah 20 It's not going to happen every single time right like within here. We don't necessarily see these Asian session lows get hit Okay, and over here. We don't see these New York session lows get hit Okay, but It's relatively consistent where we can use these highs and these lows from market opens As liquidity sweeps or fucking support and resistance whatever the fuck you want to call it For new session opens Okay, so we'll do like one more example of this And just see how it reacts Okay Okay, so right here This was a failed attempt. We have London session lows and then London session highs Right here we drive into these lows we get a slight push up. We don't quite hit these London session highs And then we end up selling off so that's an example of where look we probably wouldn't have been able to win a trade on that And And again, we aren't even talking about executions right now We're I really just want you guys to see How price reacts off of these low so again, we have lows right here. We've highs up here. None of those get hit Let's see if there's anything else during one in session and again, this is like Three sessions it encapsulates like a full day. Oh wait. Yeah, this is literally perfect London session Okay, we've these London session highs right here New York session opens pushes past those highs and then these would be London session lows smacks those lows and goes even lower Okay, so what I want you guys to do is just mark out these time zones and these timeframes And just see how price reacts Often these 30 minute highs and lows from every single session. Okay Again, it's the session highs and the session lows on the 30 minute time frame box off from the base to the high from the base of the low And that's all that I want you guys to do for now So we can start getting a feel for how price reacts to these highs and to these lows within the market cool cool welcome to the fucking forex transformation bootcamp Whatever you want to call it hopefully you guys enjoyed this first little video again. It was pretty vague But this is just like the first little start of us getting into this Forex strategy of us seeing and how we can take trades off of session highs and session lows pretty much throughout every single session To potentially get literally three trades a day if you're trading every single session. So Oh you guys know what I mean anyways forex strategy creation part two Fuck it. Let's just bang all this. Let's just fucking gang bang this shit out today gang bang sniper gang all this shit out today right here right now Donkey Kong style You know what I'm saying all right, so as we remember From last time all that we were doing was just marking out session opens Let me go back to the baby pips shit So I can remember what they are because I only remember it from if you guys remember way back on my old videos Uh, I only did like London session time. So it's kind of different now that I'm only doing Futures. I'm going to finish up the forex strategy creation video right the fuck now Um in this video who knows how long it's going to take okay, so Asian session starts at eight so that would be 20 20 Q that Asian music And then three for London session and then eight for New York session literally like everything I've given you guys the like literally strategy that I use for futures. I've given you guys now A fucking forex strategy the strategy for futures works for forex too people in my mastermind Have been using the Strategy that I taught you guys on futures for forex and it's been working great for them So literally just find the strategy that works well for you and run with that shit, but other than that let's let's get started in this bitch so We'll start off um And honestly just get going so as you guys Remember from last time the keys to be on the 30-minute timeframe and all that we're doing is we're marking the highs and lows from every single session with A little rectangular box. Okay, so boom we put that on boom we put that on Okay, and we see how these areas Get respected these price ranges get respected if they either get swept or revisited and respected Pretty much all the fucking time um, let's go ahead and put on this one Okay, and then let's go ahead this one and then This we didn't really have much fucking action. I'm just gonna Crush this bobber right here put this sloper topper right here Put um I'm actually getting uh get rid of this just for fucking. We'll move from here And then we'll get go okay You'll hear me. I'll pay an attention get ready because we're trading gbp Japanese yesh it yin um cheese Yen okay So remember we mark out these 30 30-minute highs and lows from the base of the candle down to the low and literally I know it sounds fucking corny, but we typically use these as just like supportive resistance and I know it sounds fucking crazy But uh fuck whose theory was it um? Oh my god, I learned this way back in the day There was some book of some go to dastrater where he talks about um How session highs and lows get respected in the price ranges Get respected. I forget who it was. It was like something Williams Will something William whatever there was a whole lost book on it. I read it. It was fucking awesome and then in turn I don't know if any but like this is literally just some shit that I fucking crafted myself obviously it incorporates liquidity sweeps in that stuff, but Like I kind of just figured this shit out trading gbpjpy Um for a long ass time and it worked really fucking well. So now here it is. I'm giving it to you guys So essentially you mark out the highs and lows you guys already learned that and then from there You scale out into the five-minute time frame and you just simply wait for those hourly highs and lows to get hit okay, so Or sorry not hourly 30-minute okay, so we have both our highs and our lows We see the high get pushed above and broken above Okay, so from if if we see a break above it, we're probably thinking okay Our next chance to even take a trade on this is going to be a revisit of the of the session high, okay, and this was uh agent or sorry London session, okay, we see price pullback. We don't get back to the high Okay, we see price push up and then boom we get back to the high next what are we looking for? This is now part of the strategy Again, you guys will remember we're looking for a five-minute break of structure and then this is actually going to be adding on something that A confluence that I would like to add to this it's just like our future trading strategy We're looking for a five-minute break of structure when these highs and lows get tested revisited or like swept Okay, we're looking for a break of structure And then we're looking for one of our several confluences either a fair value gap equilibrium Order block breaker block, okay, anything. Okay, so here Yes, do we see a break of structure right here? Absolutely, but do we see this imbalance get filled and moved off of no, okay, so even though we pushed in here got a break of structure We don't give a fuck about it. We push it in a little bit deeper and then we get a break of structure again Right here. Do we give a fuck about this? Yes. What are we looking for? We're looking for an imbalance to get filled We're looking for equilibrium. I'm not gonna lie. I probably wouldn't have taken this trade just because it's so high up, but we can see That price ends up boom pushing in here pushing out and then from there in terms of targets It's just like again go rewatch any of my take profit videos Okay, we want to see price revisit highs. Okay, so we have highs right here that gets hit But again, that would be like a baby food As take profit probably like a negative risk reward ratio. Okay, so where else can we look we can look at Fugging these highs right here. We can look at this high-time frame order block right here regardless price Would have hit Damier all of our take profits because we see it comes out and takes out all of these highs as well Okay So boom first example said and done okay, so let's delete that now and then let's go into the next session And we're literally just going to break this down on gbpjpy gbp usd Fuck it. We can go into gold and just see how it works, okay? So next session Let's go ahead and mark out these highs from this was London session highs And let me delete these London session lows for now London session highs. We can go ahead and get rid of these get rid of these London session lows Okay, what do we see price do boom? We see a push into London session highs Okay, what are we looking for? We're looking for a break of structure. Do we see one right here? No? Do we see one Right here? Shit looks pretty fucking close. Let me see the High of this candle was at 191.862. Where's the close of this candle? Wow literally 0.001 higher Then this high so technically It broke structure, okay, and then from there we're looking for a third confluence We have an imbalance right here. We don't see it get filled it ends up pushing down here sweeping out liquidity Okay, and then pushing higher. Okay, so we do end up getting break of structure cool Or back up again structure was already broken with this Again, this to me seems a little bit too far gone, but We can see that it still would have ended up playing out. We see an imbalance right here Price fills it we get a bullish reaction out of it. Okay, you could have entered here And then in terms of take profits. Fuck it. Okay, we consider take profits on these highs any of these highs over here They would have ended up getting hit during New York session Pretty fucking cool, right? Okay, now let's go into the next session mark out the next session highs 30 minutes where the fuck are we That's over here. Okay, let me delete these Okay, this looks like it's going to be an L for us These are the lows all the way down here Okay, so boom we see Asian session start again look at the volume during Asian session I wouldn't recommend trading during Asian session, but fuck it. Okay We see price break above. So what are we looking for? We're looking for a break of structure Okay, so these highs we don't get a break we form a new high right here boom we do get a break Okay, we don't have a fair value gap, but Just to hold myself accountable and say Hey, we do take losses out here But when we do end up hitting equal to Rium and then reacting off of that to the upside So cool. Could we long john bomb that fuck it? Why not? I mean, hey, we do hit a one-to-one risk reward ratio before getting stopped out. Okay So Maybe just maybe you have this as a take profit. Okay, no, you would have missed it. Okay Trying to give myself the benefit of the doubt this would have been a fucking loser Okay, cuz it's fucking Asian session look at this volume's dog shit Okay, unless you try unless you're only going for one-to-one risk reward ratios cool You probably would have smacked smack that on the ass crack. Okay, but regardless Baby food we got stopped out on that moving on to the next session Okay, we have these Asian session Eyes right here and we have these Asian session Lose right here. We don't see New York session interact with any of these until London's earth Sorry, this was London session All of this was New York session then this was London session We don't see London session interact with any of these until New York session open so we can go ahead and get rid of those And then from there we can go ahead and mark out London set or yeah, London session lows This right here Okay, London session highs are going to be right here. I mean, this is like the tiniest fucking wick ever but whatever Okay, from there scaled down into five minute. We wait to see any of these interacted with Boom market opens. We should see price shit. It's pants all the way down to London's London session lows. Okay What are we looking for we're looking for breaks of break of structures Okay, do we end up getting one right here? Yes Again super volatile price action, but fuck it. We're gonna play this out As if we're taking every single trade possible with this strategy Okay, obviously you guys are going to be a little bit smarter. Let's say we're just like fucking trading robots And we're taking every single trade with this. Okay, boom We get a break of structure. How can we start looking for trades? Do we see any imbalances Low key we do see this imbalance get filled Baby asked imbalance right here. We see a get filled and then boom. We see a bullish reaction out of that shit cool Fuck it. Let's say we go long off that Stops underneath the low that it formed out of the imbalance Bet if you're going for a one-to-one that bitch would have smacked if you want to target previous Session highs would have been a negative risk for reward ratio, but it would have hit You can look over here to the left in boom now we can start using this one Okay, it's just like All of our other strategies where we target draws on liquidity Okay, so even though this is all the way super high we can probably find some sort of I don't know bearish reaction point over here Um that could give us a solid take profit area, but fuck it. We'll just put these guys on And we can see holy shit We could have got a one to three point two five or five two risk reward ratio all during Boom New York session. I'll take profit smacked. We're the fucking best pretty fucking crazy, right? We're doing pretty good with this so far Okay, let's move into the next session Okay What do we got going on we have New York session highs? Oh damn Would you look at that? Would you look at that you see on press or spend that shit you see You see on press respects that shit You see how press respects that shit see how press respects that shit. I'm gonna open up your clip I'm gonna not outside your tin. Oh, yeah, see how press respects that shit I haven't even traded forex and forever and just literally explaining this old forex strategy Do you guys makes me want to trade forex again, but no, fuck it. We're good at indexes Lock in okay I mean fucking you guys know the fucking strategy, but we're gonna keep showing you guys why this fucking works They didn't day out literally. I just showed you several sessions worth of price action where we've only lost one trade and Dove all the other ones and I'm literally just following the strategy step by step plan by plan Not I'm sorry, okay, but anyways, why did I delete that boom New York session highs blick work New York session lows are all the way the fuck down here Or no, that's not gonna be the low this is gonna be the low boom Asian persuasion starts we actually have a lot of volume on this K boom We see price Break structure the upside Okay Once we get above this again the goal is it's not Right, we're looking for two things either for this to sweet price So boom when we get above here or just within here. We're like Morning for lows, okay, we're looking at lows, but then boom We get above it and then boom we're tapping back into that shit So it just flips, okay, we see break up structure here Okay, you could literally just wait for a 30 minute closure above which would have happened right here So within this candle, I guess as it was on this one, okay So boom we get a break structure to the upside it was already bullish anyways Okay, we have several fair value gaps in the fair value gap right here gets this respected with closures underneath it Where's the next one? We have another one right here Okay, boom we see price push into it. We have another fair value gap down here. We also could have drawn on Equilibrium from these lows up to these highs Smack work with a closure above equilibrium closure out of this fair value gap long john bomb this baby Boom, we don't even need that deep of a stop loss could have put it literally underneath This candle right here or if you want to get super shy see you can put it underneath these lows Whatever works best for you and then from there And come on now give me some give me something to play with You Literally nothing to play with Fuck it. We're using Fibonacci levels at this point Fib work K take profit one take profit two take profit three take profit four Smack work all during Asian Asian session Asian persuasion You know what I'm saying Come on now I'm getting all these forex traders right Okay, moving forward Asian session happens Okay, boom we have these as what is this Asian session highs or fuck that's not Asian session highs These are Asian session highs right here Something that you guys need to be good about is noticing That this candle right here is a part of London session and this candle right here is a part of Asian session So if we form a high you guys have to understand on this line. It's not part of Asian session Okay, so this is going to be Asian session highs Okay, and there was another example of this over here Yeah, yeah, so like right here For example if we're let's fuck it. Let's say that this candle's wick is Damn, come on now Say that this candle's wick was all the way down here. You're probably thinking oh during this London session These are the London session lows know because this candle is a part of New York session So these are the London session lows. So I'm gonna keep in mind Okay, so anyways these are the Asian session highs And these are the Asian session lows Okay so London session Opens let's pop over to the five minutes see if we get any interaction with these levels We don't get any interaction with them until New York session starts but by then we get rid of these For the new sessions, okay? So boom from there. What are we looking for we can mark out London session highs Now this can be London sessions low because we form the move down during London session and then the move up during London session Does that make sense? Hopefully London session lows, okay Boom price blitz pass all of this shit Do we get a retest of it right here in a break of structure? Fuck it sure let's say that We get a break of structure We get a fair value gap filled just so I can show you guys that like fuck it If you guys were to follow this shit brick by brick step by fucking step There is losses involved Okay, so boom this would have been a fucking loss Now I think we're in current fucking day But anyways pretty fucking solid we dubbed literally every single trade except for that one that we just took and then that Asian persuasion sideways session And that one that we just took It should have been relatively obvious that we're not trying to take that especially with Again like market intuition and just obvious market um I don't want to say bias but Day trading mind would tell you that hey, we're in a pretty fucking obvious uptrend. Let's try not to take shorts But if you're just following this strategy step by fucking step you would have dubbed I don't even know how many trades we just took like out of 6-1-4 and you lost to pretty fucking solid and all the wins were much higher than a 101 restored Okay, now let's do this shit on gppjp or sorry gpp usb Let's see if it works as well Fuck here, this is what I'm just going to do chill Oh, okay, and then we're gonna change this to eight So we don't really care about the sessions session closes we really just care about Cool actually wait this can be back to 17 All right bet Let's get into this uh, fucking let's start Let's start right here, okay, so this is New York session, okay, so previous session it was London session, okay, we can see that New York doesn't interact with any of London sessions um Any of London sessions highs or lows the highs are right here and The lows are actually still right here because we can see that this low is formed this Move up was formed during New York sessions, so we don't really care about that Moving on New York session lows are going to be right here New York session highs are going to be right here Again Asian session does not tap into any of this Asian session Asian session no action We have these Asian session highs And these Asian session lows Okay, so we can see London session opens we break above that We'll see if we get anything going on within here, okay, once we break above here on the 30 minute, okay, we're looking for Price to revisit it, okay, so all that we would look for would be Where we at waiting for this candle to close above and then it's like okay bet we're just gonna flip this bitch So once we say okay bet we're looking to flip this bitch What are we looking for we're looking for a break of structure to the upside or monitoring highs? Okay, this high This high boom we get a break turned on boom fair value gap Boom destroyed. We end up coming back down sweeping out these lows. We're looking for breaks Okay, we get a break right here still nothing out of that we push lower We get a break right here Literally nothing out of this okay No Opportunity I would have loved to catch this move up but We didn't see anything out of it moving on Fuck, I don't know where we were right here, okay now it looks like we're going to actually get a good trade out of this London session highs London session lows Okay, New York session Already opens with a closure above this so we're looking to flip it Why prices fucking volatile as fucking GBP in these basketball plays Okay, we see price revisit this area. We're monitoring highs highs right here nothing highs right here Nothing highs right here boom we get a break Cool, we have an imbalance right here. I mean shit just for fucking Doing the strategy 24 7 sake Bull fucking take it Long off this shit cool if you put your stops right under here Wonder one risk reward ratio you're smacking it um I mean shit if you want to put on this Didn't wouldn't have got hit Even this high wouldn't have got hit So really just depends on where your take profit was and where your stop loss was on this You know, maybe you catch this quick little move up Honestly, I'm guessing that this would have been in L. Okay, so first trade on GBP USD with this L work Whoa next trading session We are moving into Asian session. We have New York session highs right here New York session lows all the way down here Okay, Asian session We close above it right here, so we're looking to get action out of that Cool we get a break the structure or fill this fair value gap looks like another fucking stop out on this Okay, boom. Let's say we put it right underneath here again um Damn, that's a tiny ass fucking stop loss. It's literally a one-pip stop loss. That shit ain't gonna be fucking real I mean that just goes to show like how low volume Asian session is fuck it. Let's say our stop is underneath this shit Hey, man one-to-one risk reward who knows depending on your fucking stop loss could have potentially been hit Okay, again, we don't really have much to work with over here besides these highs So again looking like another L on this strategy from GP USD not looking as hot as GBP JPY so far So Soon I'm predicting vengeance Again, this is literally just happening off the fucking dome me recording this shit um Okay, moving into London session I can already tell we have Asian session highs right here Asian session lows London doesn't interact with those Moving on we have London session lows right here and then we have London session highs right here Okay, so we get a break up above this and then from there we're looking for price to tap back into it But then boom immediate destruction to the downside way underneath this no breaks the upside boom Not many trades to be taking Take not many trades to be taken on this so far Okay Okay, moving on we have New York session highs right here New York session lows all the way down here It's going to be nothing nothing to work with Asian session closes well above this maybe we get a tap back into it Hmm nothing okay Nothing during Asian session moving forward not many trades to be taken on this um We have Asian session highs right here Asian session lows all the way down here during London session again We don't get much action on that We don't interact with any of those Now we have London session highs London session lows Going to New York New York, I mean we can see how this respects London session highs like damn near perfectly We get a break for structure to the downside um I don't really see any sort of confluence is that get filled we have this imbalance up here But we don't see that get filled we see a break for structure But we need to wait for that next confluence no equilibrium no breaker block nothing Price continues down for a little bit more so we can see that price respect to this session high, but not much came out of that And Then we're back to this shit. So honestly not much work. Let's try and move move over a little bit more so we can get more examples to see if we can actually Show this working. Okay, here's a good example of this shit Okay, we've London session highs right here Then we also have London session lows right here This had to have been on some crazy as news because we see wicks wicks, but we'll see Okay, so boom from here we get a break for structure to the upside we're looking for Some sort of confluence, but by the time we try and get a confluence we've already reached these highs So from there we're like okay, fuck it. Let's see if we respect these highs to the downside Okay, we end up getting a break for structure to the downside right here Now we can actually look for shorts off of this because we respected these highs Okay, so we go from these hot okay, first of all break for structure right here from these highs Down to these lows We hit this we respect it boom short work off of this Boom you can put the stop Above equilibrium Okay, and then you can either target previous lows made during New York session one to three risks reward ratio pretty fucking fire Or literally just previous London lows one to one point five risk reward ratio pretty fire previous Asian session lows um All of these would have gotten smacked cool Um, let's see This isn't oh wait, this was the example that we just showed um, we have New York lows right here Um, New York highs right here Asian session just kind of consolidates against that This we get a closure above but then boom break back below not much there Whole bunch of volatility from FX in this I Mean this is a pretty good example, but this looks like a news collapse But boom London session highs Okay, we push into that odds are we probably get a break Boom obviously, I mean shit. We do fill part of this fair value gap and then Boom fuck it short work off of that, but price continues lower but shit, you know, this was definitely a news candle That's pull up gold So if I remember correctly this works pretty fucking well with gold and oh baby Look at this the first shit that we just get into First of all, we have London session lows right here And London session highs right here And we can literally blick work two trades during New York session off of this allegedly Okay, so we've one in session lows right here Oh my god hell yeah, look at this shit Again, I know this is like relatively fucking cherry picking but We did a bunch of bad testing on this already, okay, and we're 35 minutes deep, but you guys get the fucking point now Okay, we push into London session lows we get a break the structure of the upside on the five minute Okay, um actually not not much of a fair value gap here, so Actually, this wouldn't have been a trade that I could take no equilibrium um Oh Hey, we have the breaker right here actually Dub work okay, we push into the breaker Bullish interaction off of that long john silvers that Blick work, okay, you can either put the stops underneath these lows that we made underneath the breaker regardless We push back into London session highs TP smack work whether it's a one-to-one risk reward ratio Or at least just to these London session highs dub nonetheless, okay now. Let's see how we can back and flip this shit To whoa, I almost said something crazy Let's see if we can flip this shit on its ass and get something back down to the back end, okay Looks like we might have gotten might be getting stopped out here, but still we're seeing the concepts be respected Okay, so from here we see push into London session highs. We get a break of structure right here Boom we get equilibrium Taped in bearish reaction out of that shit Boom stops either above these highs above these highs regardless and looks like we're going to get stopped out by this but We can still see potential For a secondary action trade if we see this shit not breaking Bet we we just won one trade we lost another one. Let's see and first of all this trade is going to cover the one that we just lost This was like minimum one-to-one Okay, so let's fuck it. Let's just say that we're breaking even on this shit so far on the two trades that we've been able to take Okay, we're able to take another one off this Okay, because we have this as the breaker boom this entire move down prior to the break of structure Hell yeah pinky toe tap work Into this with the break of structure bearish reaction out that bitch Boom short you can either put your stops above these highs above this fair value gap Just in case you think that's going to get tapped into regardless Smack work on previous New York lows smack work on previous Asian session lows smack work on All of these lows smack work smack work smack work Dubbing that shit now i'm saying Three trades that that we were able to take during New York session two turned into dubs One turned into an L Let's see if we can make anything else happen after um off of this shit uh Wow, I just got I need some fucking and I need some water I need water Give me water Um, let's see if we can get any anything else off this shit um I mean fuck this works great um We have London session highs right here London session lows right here again. This could be a back-to-back flipper. Just depends on what price does on the five minute Okay, so this looks like it's going to be one L than one dub so we see boom price pushes into this we get a break of structure right here Okay, we push into this breaker We get a bear's reaction out of that cool short stops either above here stops either above this Fuck it. Maybe even above the sweep regardless. We're going to get stopped out without hitting any take profits But then what do we do we push into the lows of London session Okay, then again, we can flip this shit on it flip this shit on its ass Okay, we get a breaker structure on the five minute right here. We can look for equilibrium Okay, we have this Up candles the breaker don't think it gets tapped into But regardless We have this as an imbalance. We see price push into this imbalance bullish reaction out of that bitch boom Long's off of it if you put your stop loss underneath right underneath these lows You would have been stopped out if you put your stop loss underneath fair value. You got you're good to go if you put your stop loss Underneath these lows you're good to go Okay, take profit set on these highs smack work Price ends up ripping all of New York session if you put your stop loss Underneath this fair value gap smack work on these previous New York highs Use the highs and lows of these sessions to your advantage if you're trading 4x They are definitely by far like in my eyes the best confluence to use. I mean look. This is another great example We have London session lows right here Spot of this shit out the corner of my eye New York session opens plunge work down into London London session lows Rips back up takes out all these highs Baby food if you ask me um I mean we can see price we have these as Asian session lows right here Um, and then we have these as Asian session highs right here You could look you say that price came in here push back up into London session highs Highs and lows lows of these sessions are really really fucking valuable Use them to your advantage um Honestly, I like marking the shit out with little lines on my charts. I'm a chart doesn't look like somebody threw up on it but regardless 4x strategy video brain dump delivered boom Happy fucking birthday um Shit man. That was a lot of info Long ass video today looking to dump a shit ton of information on you guys just like I did last summer with the bootcamp I fucking love you guys. I'll catch you guys in the next one peace out my fucking people So now hopefully you guys are able to build off the fundamentals the confluence is and now you guys have a strategy That is helping you guys make highly probable decisions within the markets on a daily basis within these next couple videos We're going to delve a little bit deeper onto again when we should be taking action with the strategy Where we should be taking action when we should be avoiding certain scenarios And then also how you guys can actually leverage these new skills and new confluence's strategy that you've learned to actually turn You guys profitable within the markets because it's one thing to understand confluence is and understand strategy But it's another thing on how to actually genuinely generate money from this new knowledge and this new skill And that's something that I struggled with that's something that a lot of students of mine struggle with and Really good example of this is somebody that recently went through the blueprint and was able to make literally over a hundred thousand dollars From being able to put together these fundamentals confluence's and strategy all together and one But they were still struggling with being able to understand like when they should be placing these trades or how they should be Going about structuring their risk management How they should be structuring their psychology and then once they came into the blueprint once they were able to get these mistakes Smooth over because right now at the start of this video you guys had a big-ass boat And there was massive holes in that boat and within this video We've been able to clog those massive holes But there's still probably little holes in your guys's boat that you guys are still slowly but surely sinking down Causing you guys to be unprofitable and that's okay and maybe throughout the rest of this video We're able to clog up those holes and if that's the case awesome my job here is finished But if you guys aren't unable to clog up those holes on your own That's where a coach and a mentor is going to help you guys significantly We're going to be able to get in there Re-shift your guys's headspace and shift your guys mindset to be able to become a profitable trader Shift and change your guys's risk management plan shift and change at what times and how you guys are actually doing about taking these trades So that you guys can again skip over these mistakes that are slowly but surely dragging you guys down and causing your boat to sink But by us being in your position before as unprofitable traders that have now turned profitable We know all these mistakes that we made in the past that you guys are making right now So we're going to be able to smooth over all of these things and get in there and actually be able to break down Hey you guys are still making this mistake. Hey you guys probably shouldn't be trading at this time Hey you guys should probably be avoiding trading high-impact news These are things that are going to drastically affect your guys's win rate your guys risk your award and your guys's chances of turning profitable Day trade even is a very difficult skill that needs to be put super high up on a pedestal Okay, it's a very high leverage skill and in order to learn these high-leverage skills You guys are going to have to make consistent mistakes and again the goal is to make a mistake once never make it again And that's what causes growth But one of the issues of being an unprofitable trader and one of the issues with these types of education videos that we're putting out is We can't get in there and personally address the issues and the questions that you guys have that may be sinking your guys's vote So that's what we do for students within the blueprint So again, if you guys want access to that you guys can click the link down in the description so that I can actually help you guys Personally with some mistakes that you guys are making that you guys aren't necessarily getting answers to within this video But with that being said now that we know the base fundamentals the confluences and how to put it together with strategy These next couple videos we're going to go into death on how we can potentially turn all of that around and help you guys become profitable How you guys can put all of these things together and again structure a strategy around it structure a risk management plan structure your headspace so that we can again put these pieces together and lead you guys towards the path to profitability So with that being said, let's jump trade into it We live in probably the easiest Generation or the easiest time to make a lot of money But we also live in the generation where it's the easiest to be lazy So if you think about like even 10 years ago or even five years ago, bro Like let's think about crypto five years ago. There wasn't like crypto twitter There wasn't like youtube videos talking about like the best altcoins or like explaining crypto If we even think about trading 10 years ago, there was not like anything on youtube Talking about this kind of stuff and helping you guys for free Like this video to be successful And you think about those people that ended up being successful in their In that time like 10 years ago or five years ago within those spaces and you're thinking well Oh, they just got lucky or they You know like they you come up with some excuse for why they were able to get to where they're at And it's like no if anything their route To being where they're at was infinitely harder than you guys because now you guys have literally an influencer or an educator on every single subject To be able to be successful and it's like holy shit If that doesn't just go to show how lazy and how complacent this entire generation has become and how short of a Uh, short little dopamine ridden fucking mindsets that most people have nowadays I don't know what does because it's like bro you have someone like me you have literally every other trading influencer teaching you guys how to trade and The only thing that's stopping you guys from being successful is yourself You guys are just too lazy and you don't see things in the long term and I've made this video a bunch of times talking about you guys God to see you the shit in the long term this shit isn't going to happen in a day It's not going to happen in a month, you know Maybe it'll happen in a couple of years I saw this video of jinksy that freaking twist streamer and you know the dude that's always bugging out whatever I saw a video He has been streaming for five years And he just caught his big break there was something like three years straight Where like he consistently only had two viewers Like imagine that That's that's what you have to be doing That's like the delusion and the consistency that you have to have in order to genuinely be successful Because he was willing he knew what he wanted to do And he just kept doing it over and over and over and over for years without seeing any results Because he saw the end game he knew Hey if I work my ass off for literally years doing this there is bound to be a result And I promise you in any other skill and anything including trading including crypto including including business If that is how you guys think if you guys just think If I consistently work my ass off day in and day out without even expecting the result at a certain time Like a lot of you guys are like I'm gonna turn profitable in a couple months I'm going to get funded in like shut the fuck up, bro You guys that's what's causing you guys to never be profitable That's what that's what's causing you guys to never be successful because when that time comes In your not successful and you don't see the result you fucking give up or you do some stupid shit That sets you guys back and recess Your consistency that you guys have been working on this entire time So why not just do the shit that you fucking love And be consistent with it and work towards it and just know I'm willing to do this shit For however long it takes Until I'm successful and I guarantee you without a doubt in my freaking mind That if you guys do that if you guys just Get like just do it consistently for ever You are going to get to that goal In anything and any skill like if like let's think about trading You guys are just like I'm going to trade Every single day until I get like really fucking good at it No matter the time frame no matter how long it takes I'm going to trade Until I'm really fucking good at it Like you already know what's going to happen You're going to trade until you get really fucking good at it The problem with you guys is you guys expect that shit to happen in like two days or two months Again, you guys need to be thinking about shit in like decades or within like five year time spans Like think about how are the things that I'm doing day in and day out going to affect me Five years from now and believe it or not like the results will come sooner than five years But you have to start thinking about it in those five year time frames In order to start being successful So that's my Monday motivation for you guys pretty much saying that the majority of you guys are really fucking lazy The majority of people who made it in the fields that you guys really want to make it in 10 and five years ago had to go through a lot harder things and had way less resources for them to be successful And we're living in a generation where it's probably the easiest Ever to make a lot of money. It is literally The money's already been printed you just got to go fucking get it like that's as simple as I can fucking put it like It's really fucking sad seeing how lazy this generation is and Like how many excuses y'all come up with when it's like broke 10 years ago This shit was not even ever happening Like there there was not nearly as much resources there wasn't nearly as much content or aid that you guys have in order to turn successful And you guys are still coming up with excuses for why you guys aren't successful It's pretty sad, but anyways here's a little freaking apesky all right get you guys Today is going to be more of a psychology Esque of a video okay where I mainly just going to be talking y'all About some mindset shit that will hopefully change the game for you guys in terms of trading now that you guys have like a Overall relatively solid strategy that can help you have an edge within the market I want to kind of circle back on some of the earlier videos within this again keep in mind What are overall goal is with trading? So this is kind of just going to be a gap attack strap in lock the fucking Leg up all right, so I'm just gonna go over I guess like main Top five tips that can help you turn into a profitable trader That's probably going to be the title of this will go with number one And that's just going to be having a long-term vision you guys have to understand that trading is not a get rich quick scheme And if you guys think that you are going to Let me circle back trading is not a get rich quick scheme you guys Convince yourselves that trading is going to get you rich quick Sometimes there's people within the space that can make you think or just certain videos within just the day trading Meach that can make you think That day trading as itself is a get rich quick type of scenario, but it's not okay And I'm here to tell you it definitely is not day trading is a skill and we'll talk about that a little bit later Okay, so you guys need to have a long-term vision on this you can't think I'm going to get into day trading and within the next month I'll be making a hundred thousand dollars in a month or oh, I'm going to make a hundred thousand dollars in a week or Oh day trading is going to help me pay off all my bills That's not going to be the case odds are you guys are going to lose money consistently from day trading from crypto from really any financial market that you try and Get into in the first place for the first one to two years and if we think about that on a skill stance point it makes complete sense like Let's say I try and pick up plain freaking basketball today, and I've never played basketball in my entire life and The first month am I going to be really good at basketball? No, I'm going to fucking suck and the first year Am I going to be really good at basketball will not necessarily will I know all the basics? Well, I know some of them like you know the majority of the moves Yeah, will I be able to hit shots you know relatively consistent consistently? Yeah, but will people see me on the court and be like he's a really good basketball player? No, and again What comes with that is that that year takes a lot of time and a lot of effort for me to even get to that point Okay, and then on top of that what happens if I add another year of lots of hard work lots of consistency working on and off the court focusing on my game then by year two I'll probably be a overall relatively good basketball player, okay, so We need to think about trading in the same way We need to understand that look in order for us to get good at trading and to get good at the skill of knowing where price wants to go every single day Because that's what trading is trading isn't about making money. It's about predicting where price wants to go Every single day and that's where a lot of people get their shift flipped and we'll talk about That even more later on okay, but for the time being Tip number one is have a long-term vision understand that day trading is not going to get you out of your debts Day trading is not going to get you rich quick You need to see day trading in the long-term vision say look if I can put my head down and focus on this skill That's going to take several years to learn but when I do learn it I have The biggest edge within the market and I have one of the biggest edges as a human to be able to predict where financial markets want to go and In turn What is a awesome reward that comes with that a shit ton of money because we're able to actually like place bets or Actually put money on these predictions that we've trained so long and hard for That's where the reward comes from okay. It's not just trying to make money. It's trying to understand how price moves Okay, so that would be step one Step number two it's going to be hard work and consistency, okay, so and also Doing the right work, okay, so Hard work consistency and then doing the right work consistently and hard pause no ditty bobber um But you guys get what I'm saying, okay? First of all we know what we want to do we want to be able to predict price action We want to be able to predict where price is going to go Pretty much every day every hour of the day every second of the day 24 7365 are we ever going to get to that point probably not but will if we put in enough time and put in enough effort Can we potentially get to that point? Yes okay So we want to keep that in mind All right, so we have to work our fucking ass off to even get and obtain that skill again We need to think of day trading as a skill of being able to predict where price wants to go day in and day out So what comes along with that? You can't just watch a five minute youtube video and then boom we're gonna be profitable or we'll be able to predict where the market goes No, it's going to take a lot of time and it's going to take lots of hours in the chart It's going to take lots of hours and repetitions. There's that famous Kobe quote um or whatever that book like 10 10,000 hour rule where in order to be a master has something you have to put 10,000 hours Uh worth of work and practice into your craft Okay, the same thing applies to trading if you want to be a master at trading you have to put 10,000 hours in Okay, get your fucking hours in and how do you get your hours in? It's by literally just sitting your ass down and fucking grinding bro so That's step one hard work, okay, and then on top of that it's going to be consistency Let's say one day you're just like I really want to do trading and you're just like super sporadic and you spend 10 hours in one day studying and grinding trading and then boom the next month you try and trade But you're not studying and you're not You know like continuing to learn and work on your craft Then what happens? You know you only spend 10 hours Working on the skill and then you Wasted an entire month of just fucking squandering it trying to get rich quick Okay, so we need consistency with our learning of the skill, okay And then last within the second tip is going to be Consistency and hard work on the right things, okay? So you guys need to understand that studying and trying to learn 10,000 different strategies And spending an hour on each one of those 10,000 strategies is not going to turn you profitable Within the market you want to be really good at mainly just three things within trading We want to simplify our skill set within trading what just trading what really makes up trading Let's think about all the successful all the profitable traders that you guys could ever think of What are the main three things that they say Discriminates them. Whoa pause no racial um, but you know what I'm saying what what are the three things that Causes a profitable trader to be different than an unprofitable trader. What do most people say they say their psychology is on another level They're able to perform robotically throughout the market. So Boom you can spend a portion of your 10,000 hours fixing your mindset fixing your headspace making sure that you're Robotic within the market making sure that your emotions are no longer attached to your trades boom psychology Next risk management, okay, there's a lot more to risk management and I've explained to the this to my mastermind students There's a lot more to risk management than just Oh risk 1% per trade and stick your stop loss and stick your take profit There's a lot of analytics and data that goes into that and Fuck it. Maybe I make a fucking YouTube video on that and add it to the trading transformation talking about risk management And how you can look at your percentages like your win rate percentage How you can look at your risk reward and then how that goes into profitability spend some of your 10,000 hours Studying your risk reward. How can I get a better risk reward studying your win rate? How can I get a better win rate? How can I avoid losers and how can I consistently pick winners? Okay? And then boom grow from there and then third Last and finally what is another thing that makes us a successful day trader is our edge within the market and that's strategy Okay, so spending 10,000 hours on just strategy Purely dedicating time to just candlesticks moving up and down within the market Yeah, that's going to give you part of the edge, but on top of that we need to be studying our mindset And we need to be studying our risk management in order to in order to be a fully profitable trader because what happens if we Know where price wants to go, but we suck at risk management one trade can wipe us out Right, if we know exactly where price is going to go, but we risk a hundred percent of our portfolio every single trade and we know That not every single day trader is going to have a 100 percent win rate That person eventually is going to get wiped out what happens if We have good risk management and we have a good edge within the market, but we can't keep our emotions under control. So we keep Cutting off our winners too early. We don't let our winners ride to take profit And we keep cutting off our losers too early So sometimes price my dip down and you're like, oh no, I'm too scared Cancel and then boom you end up losing a trade that would have ended up being a winner That's why we need to fix our mental so boom That's tip to work hard work consistently and work on the right things Okay, and I just went in super crazy detail about some of the right things that you guys can work on Okay, this is literally off the dome piece just trying to give you guys some extra information And just some fucking tips and tricks, bro. I want you guys to be pro fucking profitable. You guys are my dolls Let's go into tip number three. Oh treat this shit like a fucking job, bro A lot of people I mean look A lot of people like to come at me on the internet saying TJR doesn't take trading seriously TJR he teaches this shit like it's fun and fucking games he teaches this shit like it's a like oh like they don't need to be taking it seriously That's not true. That's not true at all. Okay There's a difference between having fun with your work and treating your work Like it's not a fucking job One if you guys Think about me trading when I'm trading am I just gooffully like saying what if I went long here And clicked by with no stop loss no take profit what I ever do that no What I ever full pour on news no Do I execute with good risk management good mentality with an edge within the market every single time that I place a trade yes Do I like to make you guys actually enjoy fucking trading because we should all be enjoying our work Treat trading like a fucking job and then we'll Whoa, geez. I didn't even mean to do that um That was crazy But Treat trading like a job, but there's no problem having fun within your job a lot of people are like Yeah, you need to make trading fucking if you're like Look Trading and honestly all of work is a skill right Most skills can be kind of gamified Me personally trading is one of the best games ever When I play basketball I'm having fucking fun. I'm talking shit I'm laughing in my opponent's faces when I hit a fucking crazy move. I'm celebrating Trading is no fucking different I know there's the difference between me being like super lit after getting a win and like Just you know like just being like hell yeah, I'm fucking cop the dub versus like actually being emotional about it you guys have to Identify the difference between the two I don't give a fuck if I win or if I lose within the market because I understand my risk going into every single trade That's what good traders do Just because I say hell yeah, I fucking want to trade that's fucking awesome. I'm not celebrating Because of the money that's the difference I'm celebrating because we did a good fucking job within the market and I'm not fucking crying and beating my fucking ass and oh Where where where I just lost this this amount of money No, when I miss a fucking big shot in basketball am I really fucking upset about it? Yeah But what does that make me do it makes me want to practice and motivates me to work even harder To be able to make those shots. It's the same thing in trading if I lose a trade I get fucking pissed off and my pissed off about the money though hell no I'm pissed off that I wasn't good enough at trading to know that that was a bad trade to take So what do I do? I go back into the charts and I figure out what the fuck I did wrong Okay, if you aren't having fun Doing your fucking work and why the fuck are you doing it as a job? Like genuinely find your fucking passion. I This is like most people see me as a fucking cool guy. I'm a fucking geek when it comes to this shit I like bro. I love seeing the fucking numbers. I love seeing the candlesticks. I fucking love this shit Okay, and if you guys don't love trading for what it is which is predicting where price wants to go on a daily fucking basis I love being right this market helps literally gives me the gives me the opportunity to be right And to prove 99% of people wrong on a daily fucking basis Because 99% of traders are going to be losing every single day and if I'm able to be one percent of those people That's right that fills me with fucking joy and I love the competitiveness about it Did I say anything that involves money when talking about why I like trading in that sentence? No, if you guys are getting into trading For the fucking money you guys are getting into it for the wrong reason You need to actually be trading because you truly love Being right within the market being able to predict where the market goes And if that's not you then you should just get the fuck out of trading love your work And if you love your work you'll be able to work forever. That's like my fucking motto You've got to be able to love what you do number four. We need to trade treat trading like a fucking skill Okay, and if we don't treat trading like a skill then we'll never get good at it again This kind of merges into you guys getting into trading for the wrong reasons Okay First of all, we have to understand that we are going to suck at trading at first just because we watch a strategy video and the strategy Does it wow Greeks doesn't work for us Doesn't mean that the strategy doesn't fucking work Maybe it's because you've only spent five minutes watching a YouTube video and then you risk live fucking Funds and you've never taken a trade with that strategy in your entire life And you haven't even put any single time into backtesting it and any fucking time Into working and grinding on that edge within the market you ever thought about that you ever thought about Why those strategies that you watch a five minute YouTube video on and then go and try and figure them out and try and trade with your Funded account on it because it's the oh this strategy will help you pass your funding account in two fucking days You guys got to understand First of all strategy isn't necessarily what turns us profitable We just have to have a edge within the market. So if we think about all profitable traders In the world, okay Most people have different strategies than others, right? There's a bunch of different profitable traders in the world And all of them have different strategies then a bunch of a bunch of other profitable traders There's no right way to fucking trade Okay, so stop getting in take talk comment sections and YouTube comment section saying Yes, and you don't know what you're talking about if he's profitable. He's fucking profitable and you're still unprofitable. So shut the fuck up Okay And moving on from that we have to treat trading like a fucking skill. So we're going to suck dick at it Still doesn't sit right um We're going to suck at the day trading skill okay and We have to understand that and we have to understand that skills get built over time with hard work consistency consistently doing the right up the right work hard Again pause um And we have to understand that we're looking to build the skill of predicting where price wants to go Not Focus on making money within the market because if we go into the market thinking how can I make the most amount of money Today What is that going to cause us to do when it comes to trade it? It's causing it's going to cause us to take a trade on every single pair And it's going to cause us to over leverage on every single pair That's short-term thinking because we get into the market and we think how can I make the most amount of money today Versus if we think How can I learn how to predict price action so that over a course of a long period of time over the course of my entire fucking life Will I be able to make a significant amount of money over a long period of time because of this skill That's what you guys should be focused on getting into the market focus on the skill set Not the money that comes with the skill if we think like LeBron just dropped one of the hardest quotes ever talking about this He said a lot of the young rookies are coming in coming into the fucking league and coming into the game And they're focused on the wrong things they're focused on the fucking watches They're focused on the cars they're focused on the chains and he said Focus on the game and all of that will come with it It's the same with literally any fucking job focus on the fucking game focus on the skill set and the money is just the best fucking Side effect that comes with that okay So boom that's for okay boom this is going to be the last one how to be a profitable day trader don't You need to put all your eggs in one basket When learning a skill for the first time okay, this is kind of applicable to every fucking side hustle ever If you if you're trying to learn day trading drop shipping Amazon FBA tick talk shop and Fucking I don't even know some other bullshit You are spreading yourself way too thin and you're pretty much allocating a fifth of the time to all five of those skills When you could just be allocating a hundred percent of your time to one single skill so Again a lot of people get into day trading for the money you guys are probably trying to do a bunch of other side hustles for the money Look at all those side hustles and you know hey all these side hustles They will make me a lot of money if I dedicate a shit ton of time to them But I can't be doing all of them at once So what do you need to do choose the one that you like the best because That's what you're going to succeed most with that's what you're going to be able to do the most amount of work with everyone Like to pull up that thing that says oh millionaires have Fucking seven streams of income so I'm gonna start off when I'm fucking broken shit Doing eight different things and I'm gonna have a bunch of different streams of income fucking idiots, bro This is how it actually works you start off and you have one single cup and you pour your heart and fucking soul and percent of your skills and effort and work and consistency into that cup until that cup turns into a fucking well oiled Machine when it starts it's gonna be like To be able to fill up and you're just gonna be Fucking shaking your hand to be able to fill that cup up But then eventually that cup is going to be steadily flowing with a bunch of fucking water and a bunch of fucking cash And you're going to know how to do it. You're gonna have teams that are going to be doing it for you Whether it's a business or whether it's trading you're going to know exactly right when you get on the chart What you're looking for how to execute where your mindset should be like and once that's taking care of and once that cup is Overflowing in a well oiled machine That's when you bring another cup into the system because you already know how to trade or you already know that this business is running Well on itself and you don't have to do all the fucking dirty work for that business or for trading or for Fucking dropshipping. It's just working on its own That's when you bring another cup in and then that's when you take the overflowed fucking water from the first cup And then you start pouring it into the second cup and then from there boom trading. It's fucking automated You already know okay? I spent three hours of date of a day day trading now. I can start a business within something else that I fucking love Whether it's fucking clothing whether it's on fucking Business within the trading niche like I did okay? You can get into that and then boom you got to do the dirty work Until that business or that fucking other side hustle starts actually working again Okay, and becomes a well oiled machine boom then we stash that cup over there boom both the cups are overflowing well oiled machines You know exactly how they work you know exactly what's going on with them and they're just systematic You don't got to worry about them. They're just boom you bring in a third cup And now your machine when it's getting started up before you didn't have much capital on the first cup You had no capital to you know do a little drizzle oil up all the gears WD-40 Okay, but now you have a shit ton of capital because you have two cups that are overflowing consistently You also have a bunch of other skills from those two skills that you mastered and we're able to Boom pile on now you have a third cup and you're like hey, I've already filled two cups before I know exactly what this takes Boom you get the machine up and running a lot quicker than those first two cups You're able to fill it a lot quicker boom starts printing you money fourth cup fifth cup six cup seven cup all printing you money All systematic well well oiled machine, but we have to understand That what did it start with one single cup? So you guys are not making any money right now and you guys are spreading yourself way too thin You have to choose whatever skill Whatever side hustle and maybe and today I'm talking about trading because that's what I do Okay, and you have to understand if you want to get into trading You have to treat it like a fucking job and you have to put your all into it. Okay, so with that being said I appreciate you boys. I'm dipping out of here. I love y'all See you guys one of those things we will talk about today, which is PM session. So Without further ado, we're going to get into my PM session trading strategy Just kidding What are we we're trading PM session. Okay, so anyways Do I really plan on trading PM session while I'm in Puerto Rico not necessarily just because AM session is super favorable for my time zone but the reason why I was trading PM session um over yonder and Hawaii was because 330 is when market open and I was like fuck that shit I'm definitely not waking up at 3 30 AM In Hawaii. I'm just going to trade trade PM session. So for PM session we have the macro Macon kill something Whatever the most optimal time to trade is From 2 to 3 PM. Okay, we can kind of drag this over to like 130 more like Okay But anyways, it's within that time zone you should already be on the charge by that time anyways But from 130 to 3 is kind of our prime time But from like 133 PM eastern time is really our prime time to trade So if you guys are on PST this might be something that you can you can consider Because I know when I was on PST I didn't really like trading at 6 30 AM That's a little bit easier than 9 Sorry, that's a little bit easier than 3 30 but still for some of you you know Maybe you got to change your diaper before you go to preschool whatever Anyways, let's jump into this so I pretty much treat PM session similar To how I trade AM session except just on lower time frame. So again, it's the same fucking strategy Just lower time frame. So what are we looking for we're looking for lower Lower time frame liquidity sweep Okay, and by lower time frame, I mean like 15 to 5 minutes Okay, we're treating those as like our four hour and hour early and we're executing on the one minute Okay, and we'll get into that we're using confluence and trends based on the 15 minute and then on top of that We are using confluence and trends based on the five minute. I'm mainly overall I'm looking at the 15 minute um for overall like bias and direction. Okay, similar to the four hour I don't really use the five minute too much. I mainly use the five minute to identify draws on the On liquidity similar to the one hour and then I execute purely based off the one minute So with that in mind What are we looking for on the 15 minute and on the five minute? Well the 15 minute we're looking for overall trend So like this was my markups from Wednesday my last day in Hawaii And I was able to hit a trade uh hit a winning trade on this. I didn't um Post-a-trade recap on this just because I literally woke up traded and headed to the airport But anyways, um, let's just use this as an example because again you guys already know our strategy. We're looking for liquidity sweep Within obviously within the trend direction that we want liquidity sweep Break of structure Okay, and then a third confluence fill all right, and that's what we're looking for Okay, so on here on the 15 minute. What do we see? Okay, we see a sweep out of these lows Then what do we get we get a break of structure? Okay, awesome. Then what can we start looking for well We have a 15 minute imbalance. I remove this Already, but anyways, we have a 15 minute imbalance If we go to the five minute we had a five minute imbalance within here as well I also marked out this five minute order block right here boom, and I also highlighted this like this order block and this five minute breaker We're pretty much within the same region. So I just marked it out with that blue little line boom Five minute order block five minute breaker Along with a five minute fair value gap. It's just scrumptious. I've written like I just eat that shit up for breakfast Okay, so the 15 minute we're determining the trend okay boom. We see liquidity sweep prior to prior to our Shit smells so bad the flies had to come crawling out anyways. We swept We swept these lows during like we can call pre-market of PM session, okay, we break structure To the upside. So what are we looking for we're looking for buys? Okay, and if we even look into our higher time frames too during this time Okay, I guess we weren't bullish Well, I'm pretty sure we were on the fore-hour regardless the 15 minutes what we're looking at because we're trying to trade on such a small time frame Okay, so we break structure to the upside we see price push into those confluences 15 minute fair value gap Okay 15 minute order block 15 minute breaker as well with this candlestick Okay, a whole bunch of confluences along with five minute confluences. We get within that area Right And then from there What do we do we can scale down into the one minute time frame We get right up on in there and then what are we looking for we're looking for a break of structure Why because we have the liquidity sweep the high time or high time frame break of structure We have the high time frame confluence fill so then what can we do we can scale in to our lower time frame To execute so what do we look for we look for a break of structure why don't we get it? boom right here We get rid of this so you guys just don't go blind off the shit Okay, we get the break of structure right here. Okay, then what are we looking for we're looking for a third confluence Ganbox boom Drop top that right there we get a fill right within here boom bullish confluence out of that right there We didn't necessarily get any fair value gaps to get filled We have this little wick down in within here Whatever we can kind of consider this a breaker so that got filled as well Maybe you considered These candles going down pushing into this breaker as like oh That's a confluence and then you wanted to interrupt this bucket. Let's just say we entered off of this Cool long john bomb off of that stops underneath equilibrium Okay, first take profit For me was based off this okay, so this was the trade that I took it was just one to one I was in and then I was out because Again pm session. That's another thing that I noticed when I was trading in Hawaii. I only had one take profit For two reasons one because I wanted to go to the beach and I didn't want to have to be checking my phone to be Managing positions. So that's just personal options Okay, and second of all because pm session is slow as shit look at these one minute candles. Okay compared To when market opens candles. Okay, so Obviously I prefer trading am session because the price is just the movements are much cleaner Until we get around to like 11 and then shit starts slowing down Okay, and then pm session opens and and shit starts moving a little bit You know more than whatever this shit is, but it's still pretty fucking slow Okay So that's the main reason why I only set one take profit on my shit But boom as you can see price hits take profit now. Let's go back and let's go over the other trades Let me just have a little shit The other trades that I took NQ I took Two total trades I won one and I lost another one and ES I took two total trades as well over my little pm session trading hiatus and I won both of them. So only one loss Um while I was trading pm session, which is pretty fucking fire and I really liked trading on those low time frames And I'm honestly kind of considering or here. You know what we can do we can just fucking Backtest the days that I didn't trade so I didn't trade on Thursday or on Friday. So fuck it. Let's let's backtest those days And who knows how that's gonna go Cuz I don't even know like I didn't even look at the market Okay, so boom this is pm session. Oh, yeah, we can already see that this is just like motion um session as we can see a m session a lot more movement Okay, but anyways Another thing that's kind of like a little tip and trick that I like to look look for during an a m session Is pm session will typically or so? During pm session. Sorry a m session will typically make a big volatile move in whatever direction that I want to go in And then it will start cooling off And then that cool off usually leads into pm session and then the move will typically continue That's Look that's just coming from the shit that I've seen over the past week of trading pm session Don't take that as just like the golden fucking rule, but that's what I've seen Okay, so again What do we see coming into pm session we have a break of structure on the 15 minute I mean the 15 minute stayed bullish throughout all this but anyways We're bullish coming into this, okay? On the 15 minute time frame, you know, we do want liquidity sweeps. Did we get any going through here? No, but what can we look for we can look for those five minutes Those five minute sweepers, okay? And boy do we get a five minute sweepy right here Clapped, okay And really another thing that pm session loves to do is it loves to just come come out and like it loves to sweep out Again, this is like purely just based on shit that I've seen it loves to sweep out like these Kind of like here. Let me go Back to Wednesdays shit It loves to sweep out those little gritty and fucking grindy Grinded ass lows that market has made During a m session leading into pm session and like this is what I mean I mean, it's all these little itsy bitty spider ass fucking lows right here You know pm session really just wants to fuck all of these over Okay, and are we gonna mark these out as liquidity? No, but can we kind of use that in the back of our head like O pm session wants to come through and like ruin all these lows day and Everybody who's just like I'm gonna scalp this move, you know, they're just gonna get fucked That's what pm session wants to do it wants to come through and it wants to take out all those little gritty and grindy as lows That get made on that like slight partial ass move up. Okay, so Similar situation here except we had a bit of a liquidation right here already But boom we come through we sweep out these lows Okay, and since we're already bullish on the 15 okay, we're green bean Ready to rock Okay, we see a sweep on the five minute again similar to a sweep on the one minute. What can we do? We can scale down. What are we looking for breaking structure on the one minute boom we get it right here or fuck it We can say that we get it right here Okay, what sort of influences can we can we use well technically this order block Boom beam work. Okay, what else do we have we have this breaker right here, which doesn't get end up getting hit We have fair value gaps through here, which don't end up getting hit We have a fair value gap right here, which ends up getting hit but invalidated so really Our main entry point is going to be this order block boom. What can we do? Long john silver Off of this candle right here Where can we put the invalidation underneath the order block so this whole move down? Okay, and then where can we target Damn, we're gonna have to do some research Let's see Over here. Let's see if this hourly highs within it's like range for good rr and then We also have this start of this imbalance right here We move the end of the imbalance right here and then we can do the start of this imbalance cool skill back down Okay, yeah, so this one way too fucking close to entry The next one we'll see if it's good rr probably not yeah Okay So again Similar situation here Yeah, we found a good rr for it whatever Obviously, this is pretty cherry picked because we we see what happens afterwards But again, proof and products we see we identify the 15-minute trend we see that there's a break structure we see uh, we see a five-minute liquidity suite we're already within if uh We we push down into like a 15-minute imbalance All the good stuff price continues higher and continues filling in balances and taking out liquidity Cool, cool now let's move over to friday and then that will be the last of our drilling Such a fucking perfect example of this shit. I can literally see the shit from a mile away dog Tell me this shit ain't working tell me the shit ain't twerking Holy moly, okay What do we see here 15-minute before PM session gets cracking sweep these lows Break structure to the upside Boom Both of the confluences already filled now. What are we looking for we have a 15-minute fair value gap right here You know Scale into the five-minute we have those gritty fucking griny ass lows lows that we were talking about That we didn't necessarily see as much get taken out The last time around but again we see like those it's ebidsy spider-ass lows that just want to be ripped to shreds Okay, it's ebidsy spider-ass low it's ebidsy spider-ass low it's ebidsy spider-ass low it's ebidsy spider-ass low Okay If we go to the five-minute we can see even more detail here Okay, we have this five-minute order block Right here we have this five-minute breaker which is in line with this five-minute the value gap unicorn Unicorn whatever you want to call it we're getting into this bitch Okay, we're scaling in we're waiting for a one-minute break of structure Which unfortunately doesn't necessarily happen until all the way the fuck up up here Okay, because we have this absurd high that was made Boom, but we get a little breaky-wakey Okay Let's see damn I don't think that's a fair value yet I don't think I would have been able to get a trade on here. I mean the slightest sliver But that's not something that I would have taken a trade off of let's see if we hit equilibrium if not I Didn't hit it But again proven product let's say like you're just I don't know maybe a bit of a dumb ass and you just enter purely off of the break of structure cool I'm Let's say you just did that proof of product, you know, you wouldn't have gotten stopped out on this if your stop was under here If your stop was under here, we see price moves up we take out these highs Do we hit these highs no not quite but we take out other highs along the way this high right here this high right here There has to be a take profit along those along there at some point in time Okay, and boom Crush the shit So there you go I'll go ahead and kind of Write out how I would go about trading PM session. So first of all be Chill with the caps lock Identify 15 minute trend second Um Look for technically low time frame liquidity sweep, but don't be going on the one minute. So five in slash 15 minute Okay three Okay fine third Confluence Within the five minute slash 15 minute and then for Execute on The one minute Boom and blouse that's how I trade PM session. That's what really fucking worked for me while I was trading in Hawaii Do I think I'll ever trade PM session again? I mean shit if I'm ever in Pacific standard time Maybe I will if I'm ever in Hawaii again. Maybe I will But and fucking maybe if I don't catch a trade during AM session um If I don't catch a trade um During AM session maybe I'm like okay cool. I'll spin back and trade PM session because I know what works But there you go for people who are on the islands obo in Oahu, Maui, Kawai, Big Island Whatever the whatever the other Lesser kind of not as cool Island is um If you're in California leave um Yeah, other than that man that covers trading PM session. All right, boys catch you guys in the next one Today we are going to be going over time within the market. So without further ado, let's get into it All right, this should be pretty short It's really just going to cover the best times that I found to be trading During New York stock exchange, okay? So the first time in what a lot of people call this is like the macro kill zone And I honestly agree with that a lot of times I Preach to never take a trade before 10 PM and I still Hold that to be true, okay? So a lot of times we'll have today was a bad example because we have ppi news data Let's go ahead and mark out yesterday We have 930 or sorry we have 830 First of all, it's just smart to know when all of this is happening. So first of all 830 is going to be pre-market open, okay? And we can get some activity within here But it is all almost always in your best interest to not trade during pre-market and then we have a full hour of pre-market And then boom and 930 we have market open and then from there we have another 30 minutes until that 10 PM mark and it's really at like 950 That the kill zone starts and it goes from 950 To around 1010 where we have Elite setups for trades to be taken so again from 950 to 1010 Don't ask me why that's just typically when the market likes to offer us Good times to enter why because the four hour candle closes at 10 Okay, so 10 minutes Before that we can get some serious action this four hour candle closes this one hour candle closes There's a bunch of candle closures that can cause a lot of movements within the market So that's why this is a very hot topic kill zone, okay? So From 950 to 1010 is always going to be a really solid time to start to find like Either a liquidity sweep or to find an entry for your trade, okay? That's typically When I start I start to start looking for entries and as we can see here, okay? We form a high and then Really right after that at around 1025 we get a sweep of Of these highs and this would have been the trade of the day to have cells right out of that, okay? um And again, this varies day to day, but a really good Standard and rule to have for yourself is never really try and look to execute before 950 And again the reason for that is because pricing developing and Price typically isn't going to make the majority of the move. I mean on this day It it made the majority of the move during pre-market, okay? With this leg up and then boom right when market opens it falls But we can see that price sets sets itself up for another leg down within that kill zone Okay, we can show another example of that over here And then we'll go over the PM kill zone and again like I said This is really just talking about the optimal time to trade There's nothing really like super duper special for this besides like the simple shit as you should be looking to trade during these times And right here boom like we can see this is a real obvious window Of where the majority of the move happens so we can see boom. This is market open Okay, we can see that market opens and we start lagging up towards this draw on liquidity. We see the liquidity sweep Okay, right around that 950 mark and then boom within there you should have found some sort of entry boom 950 hits Okay, we're looking for a break of structure to the downside. Okay, we see it here. No third confluence Boom, we see it here. Maybe we find an entry off of this as price legs down further Okay, so this is going to be our first kill zone from 950 all the way till 1010 This is a really optimal time frame to start looking for entries and to look for your main high time frame Confluence is to beginning hit during this time. Okay, so market opens and usually for the first 30 or 20 minutes Price is just going towards that draw on liquidity or going towards a confluence for price to give you an entry for price to draw Into the main draw on liquidity, which we can see here we had lows right here lows right here lows right here lows right here and all those end up getting taken out But what happened we had to gear up for that legs up and then we see the execution come in within this time frame, okay So that's for am session now. Let's go into pm session is really going to be from 1350 214 10 okay because pm session starts right I mean technically pm session starts at 1300 okay right here But this is kind of that main macro because we have like one hour and all that okay and as we can see Within this time frame if you guys remember that pm session strategy we can see Okay, price comes down. We take out a draw on liquidity Right here price continues higher super low volatility because this was in no news Monday, but we can go ahead and see how that looked Last Friday for potential entries So again, we're looking for 1350 boom right here 1410 Okay, so we can see that right before this we get a sweep of liquidity We get a break of structure the upside and then from there we see a fill of this imbalance price continues higher Okay, we didn't necessarily get that super optimal entry within This pm session kill zone and again, it's not something that's supposed to be super strict like I can only enter within these time frames But it's around these time frames that market typically wants to draw towards liquidity or cause a trade entry to get pop in to get happened Okay, let's go to Thursday and let's see the same thing happen. Okay, so this is market open right here 950 1010 so If we go over here we can see boom market opens 950 hits okay We get a strong leg up and then where do we get our execution point? We get our execution point within these fair value gaps within here oops sorry Where we can find a high-confluence trade setup to the upside because we can see market opens We see a sweep of equities we see a breaker structure the upside boom We see our third compluence get filled we can find entries within there Okay, now let's go to pm session 1350 1410 Okay, not much going on within here besides us seeing okay, we're continuing within our bias to the upside we can see That market wants to come down take out the strong liquidity We didn't really see many other sweeps of liquidity within there and again happens right after this little kill zone Which again is okay? We just know that these are the certain time frames where typically market is going to be seeking out draws on liquidity It's going to be wanting to move and it's going to be more volatile and have more volume as we can see We get a sweep of that continue higher and continue within the trend that was started during AM session. We'll go over one more Before I leave you guys Okay, so we have market open right here 950 1010 Similar situation here okay during pre-market we have a sweep of liquidity We have a breaker structure the upside during this kill zone. We see market drive into a fair value gap and give us a great Execution point right at that 1010 mark for price to continue higher and seek out draws on liquidity up here Perfect now. Let's go into PM session. We have 13 50 right here it doesn't look like we're going to get much within here 1410 not much going on during PM session But we can see within the same hour or right towards the same hour We see price drive down fill in this liquidity or sorry fill in this imbalance and drive back higher taking out boom These highs right here and waking out these lower time for implies right here Let me do one more Okay, so again similar situation. This is our kill zone and we see price wants to move a little bit lower Sweep out this liquidity and then boom price moves higher. We end up taking out these highs taking out this high right here boom perfect now. Let's go into AM session. We have market open Boom 950 and you guys can see where this is serving us up 1010 Okay Right within this kill zone is where we see the draw on liquidity boom we see low time frames get swept out boom we also see this get swept out Boom okay, we can find entries Within this kill zone to go long sending price higher and during pre-market we can see that price swept liquidity Broke section of the upside we see this come down fill in this order block boom price continue higher So That pretty much covers my Favorite times the trade and again, we kind of covered that in PM session But I figured hey why not making actual full when are my optimal times the trade okay? I don't necessarily follow like icts kill zone to a fucking tee. I don't necessarily um Follow all the macro this and that okay. I know that time is a huge It's a huge thing in trading okay, and for me It's always like I'm trading market open and I know that I'm typically going to be waiting until 950 or around 10 to be looking to enter into a trade And I know that during that 930 from 930 until then price is typically going towards a draw on liquidity Or it's just going to be consolidating Until we get into that one hour four hour close where Price starts to get more volatile go towards our confluences where we can start taking trades So that being said I appreciate you boys. I will catch you guys in the next one Hopefully this helped you guys figure out what time frames are kind of best for you guys to trade or not time frames What times are best for you guys to trade for market open and from PM session? I appreciate you boys. I'll catch you guys in the next one now. Let's get into everybody's been wondering saying oh You're taking trades on lower time frames. What happened to this? Wait, you're taking trades on higher time frames. What happened to this? Listen the fuck up and listen real fucking close my strategy is universal The confluence is that I teach you can apply to any time frame The strategy that I teach you can scale it down and you can scale it up and still make money baby That's what we're all about Okay, so that's what I'm going to teach you in this video before I pop up fucking blood vessel and yeah Yeah, okay, just getting let's lock in all right, so everybody let's Fucking screaming shut up All right, we're solving your fucking baby shit today man Anyways Most people know the strategy as we look at the four hour for overall baby bias then we look at the one hour See how that transcorulates and then we scale down to the 15 in the five minute and find executions on there But hold on if there's liquidity sweeps on the four hour and also liquidity sweeps on the one hour And there's liquidity sweeps on the 15 minute the five minute and even the one minute And there's also fair value you got something one minute. There's also fair value you got some the five minute There's also fair value you got some the 15 minute there's fair value you got side every single fucking time frame In all these confluence is hold true Unlaterally every single time frame. Don't you think that our strategy can be applied amongst Anytime frames Okay lock in We'll start off on the bigger time frame Let's say I want to be a swing trader. It's a simple. It's a simple as just Staling up the time frame Okay, so this is a perfect example The weekly time frame We get a sweeping poo And then a breaky shit To the downside. Oh Skill down Over time frame Okay, and we see oh the daily broke structure right here Okay, all of these confluence we see sweep we see a breaker structure. Oh on the daily We also see sweeps And brave structure Okay, so let's say I just want to be a fucking swing trader all that you do is scale up the time frames Look at the overall overall trend on the weekly right now We're still within this like bearish trend, but I honestly think that we break right back up to the upside because this just wanted to draw down So we've got liquidity and rally Cool Just applied the same concepts that we do on the four hour and on the hourly rotated over on the weekly and the daily We find our executions and our confluence is on the four hour and the hourly Okay, it's the same type of thing. So let's say on the daily we're looking for draws on liquidity and we know that we're bearish for example Let's say we see a sweep of this liquidity cool. We can scale out into the four hour Okay, why don't we get a breaker structure boom right here? Okay? We have this big ass fair value gap We see the fair value gap get filled we see rejections out of it Potential to take a short position off of this stops above that fair value gap And we can target draws of liquidity to universal There's a reason why we give you guys these concepts that work on every single time frame because you can apply them to every single time frame So from today when you guys saw me take a low time for trade Don't be like Y'all I swear you guys be taking shit like super literally and that's okay sometimes Right But for example also like the high time frame shit I'm not that big of a fan. I would rather scale down because I'm trying to move from session to session I'm not trying to deal with no freaking Weekly and daily liquidity sweeps right like we'll literally die by the time we find an entry Okay, but for example What happens if we're Going to do something like this where we use the hourly As our overall bias center oh We get a beanie bopper break of structure Beanie Bopper thought or bobber break of structureer Okay, we get that break along with that we sweep liquidity On the 15 minute Okay, we could have looked for like an hourly sweep to because now we're using the hourly in the 15 minute As our draws on liquidity in our overall trend setters Scale down to the five minute maybe try and find some confluences within there Oh, damn a five minute break of structure and then There's a five minute there valley gap and then if we want to scale down even further There There's a skirky dinky dinky dink a break of structure and then oh my goodness look at that the break of structure also coincides with an order block Right here and it's crazy. It's almost like these confluences aren't every single fucking time frame So as long as you guys have the big picture and this is really all the video is going to be is me just yelling at you guys saying that you guys gonna Find this strategy to any time frame just have that overall fundamentals of looking at a higher time frame Figure out the overall trend and again just because if I'm executing on a smaller time frame Let's see let's say I execute on this break of structure right here Long john silver Okay, and we put the stop loss Fuck it. Let's just put it at the bottom of this five five minute fair value gap because that's what we're taking to trade off Okay Am I going to set my take profit To a fucking daily high Yeah, no Okay, we're not we're not going to do that We can set our take profit to a 15 minute high I Want to 1.94 risk reward ratio I'll take that We can do like a 15 minute high previous highs like let's say this chart got a little bit higher to give us a good risk Orward boom set that as it but we're not again It's it's the same like do you guys get what I'm saying like just scale down the time frames Or if you guys want to be a swing trader scale up the time frames. It's the same strategy because these concepts Happen on every single time frame. There's liquidity sweeps on every single time frame. There's breaking structures on every single time frame There's order blocks on every single time frame. There's for value. Guess in every single time frame There's breaker blocks on every single time frame and I'm gonna go fucking crazy. I Was just showing a strategy that worked And I kind I mean, I guess I assume for all But I was assuming that you guys would understand that and that you guys would be able to Be able to like figure it out that hey, it doesn't just uh the strategy that I gave you isn't just a four hour one hour 15 minute five minute only strategy Where you guys can apply these concepts To multiple time frames. Okay, because sometimes Where there was a day I think it was yesterday Let's put like replay Like here This is what price looked like right and if we go to four hour, this is what price look like Do I really think I'm going to sit on my butt cheeks and wait For either a four hour liquidity sweep. Do you really think price is gonna be like Yeah, but we need to sweep look what I But it's not gonna do that Okay, do you really think that price is going to also this was deep in the market open anyways after it had broken structure Sometimes we can't find trade set up because it's obvious on the chart that there's no draws on liquidity on the super high time frame So then what can we do in turn we can scale down To lower time frames and this was the trade that I took yesterday on the 16th Where we see sweep way it was on NQ but whatever we see sweep And we see Confluances on lower time frames and we see the sweep on the 15 minute time frame So because we see the sweep on the 15 minute time frame We know that the move is going to be smaller than if it was a four hour sweep or an hour release sweep So in turn We use lower time frames Okay, let's say that Here I'll show the one on NQ ES we had the sweep NQ we had smt divergence right here scaling to the one minute I need to make a video on smt divergence such as reminded me Looking for confluences, okay, so 15 minute sweep on ES SMT divergence Which essentially like kind of signifies Like valid sweep in that NQ is going to continue higher but I'll make a whole other video on that later Okay, I know a lot of people in the kick streams asking for that Okay, but we see a 15 minute sweep on ES so we know that the move it's it's going to be a sweep right We saw that the sweep happened we see smt divergence, okay, and then we're starting to see confluences to the upside We invalidate this bearish very value gap we we break structure to the upside on NQ I could have entered purely off of that I waited for For gap for value gap gripper Entry stops underneath the invalidation of the for value gap One and only take profit was right here Okay Yes, I could have said higher take profits, but Because I exited because I entered on such a low time frame I had low time frame take profits as well These concepts are applicable on every single time frame and it's the same thing if you want to scale up and Wait years to enter on the daily fair value gap and break structure and all of that Okay, and you want to swing trade But I needed to make this video on how you guys can and again like Stop looking for a copy and paste One hut one two three four I'm gonna eat your ass right when you open the door ass strategy Because Sometimes that strategy won't play out for a fucking month and then what are you gonna do if we don't see a four hour liquidity Sweet, you know, it's gonna be pretty rare, but let's say we don't see a four hour or a one hour liquidity sweep For an entire month are we are we just going to sit there and never take a freaking trade ever again Like are are we going to go broke that month? no We need to be able to find and be able to analyze charts on different time frames as well And all of our concepts the strategy included can be used on other time frames So hopefully this video kind of clarifies that so you guys aren't tweaking and geeking In the trade recap videos and again if you guys think about that Guys this strategy this special strategy that I just showed you It's the exact same way that I traded PM session all last week And I'm just doing it on AM session Because price wasn't giving me good setups for the original strategy that I showed you Okay, cool we cool cool lock in so now that you guys have made it to this point in the video I'm going to tell you guys something that should encourage you guys to continue on this day trading journey Because the majority of people with long videos like this have already clicked off and have already gone to watch some different Engit payment content because they were like man 15 hours with the content This is too much. I want the easy way out But you guys were willing to stick around for this entire video this full culmination of everything that I put together Over the vast years that I've been on social media helping people turn from unprofitable to a profitable trader And guess what you guys were willing to do what 99% of people weren't willing to do Which is stay through all of this and which is to understand the education that can help you guys turn profitable and help you guys change your life And if you guys were willing to do that then I know that you guys have what it takes to be able to turn into a profitable trader There's a super cool statistic or not really that cool But it's it's kind of sad statistic But it remains true just like how I was telling you guys in the beginning of this video 99 or 98% of traders fail and it's not that they fail It's that they give up but another statistic to keep in mind and especially after you guys have consumed all of this content Is that 80% of traders that start trading within their first year fail or give up so we have that vast majority 98% of traders fail but within their first year of trying to complete day trading 80% of them give up So if you guys are able to sit through this massive culmination of education and information That already tells me that you guys have what it takes to be able to turn profitable because you guys were able to sit through this You guys were saying hey, I actually want to make this work I actually want to change my life just like how I wanted to when I was an unprofitable trader There was times when I would literally sit down and I was at my parents house back in California And I would sit down and I would be like look I want to do anything possible I would sit and watch the charts for hours just like how you guys sat on here and watch this day trading education video for hours I watch similar videos just like this but there were a lot shorter and they weren't really as in depth and they weren't really as good But I would watch these day trading videos that would last hours because I was so committed to being able to turn profitable I really love this skill and intern it has helped me change my life forever And I know that if you guys go through all of this content and actually apply it It's going to help you guys change your life as well So I really want you guys to think about that statistic It's not that 98% of traders fail It's that 98% of the people that tried a trading end up giving up and they don't give it a long enough shot And they don't expand their time horizons to understand that hey, this is a very high leverage skill And it's going to take time and it's going to take effort Just like the time and effort that you guys put in to this video taking notes Actually learning and understanding the fundamentals the confluence is how to put everything together And then how to shift your mindset to be able to turn into profitable traders All of those things put together can put you guys on this path towards profitability It's not going to be easy It's going to be very difficult But the fact that all of you guys were able to make it to the end of this video Really tells a lot about your guys's character and how bad you guys want this Like I said, this video is going to get a lot of views But I can almost promise you that the majority of people are going to stop watching this video 30 minutes in maybe an hour in maybe two hours in But you guys were the ones that were able to stick to it And get to the very end of this video And we're actually able to outlast everybody else That is actually putting you guys in that category Or the potential to be a part of that category That is part of that two percent of traders that are willing to make it Because you guys were willing to do what 98% of people weren't willing to do Which is stick to it which is get on here And actually digest the information, understand the information And then go out and apply the information on a daily basis And learn from your guys's mistakes Learn from these lessons and failures that you guys are making in the market And because you guys got through this video It's telling me that you guys aren't willing to give up Because again, like I was saying, there's a lot of people that are going to get on here And be like, yeah, I can't wait to start day trading And then they get through the first hour and they're like, you know what? It's too hard, I don't want to do that And that's the problem with everybody that's trying to make money They think that it's going to be super easy But you guys understand the difficulty and the level of education That is necessary for you guys to turn profitable And that puts you guys in honestly the highest tier of people who I know can personally be successful Because trust me, I was in that same exact position as you guys were And I went through all the work and all of these Long ass nights of studying day trading videos Reading day trading books And just watching the charts move for hours and hours and hours Like you guys probably have after trying to apply all of these concepts That I've taught you guys in this long ass video So I know that every single one of you guys that has made it to this point You guys have a hundred times the potential that you guys think And I can see it in you guys just like how I saw it in myself And I'm sure you guys see it in yourself Because you guys were able to make it to the end of this video You guys wouldn't have made it to the end of this video If you didn't think that you weren't able to do it Everybody that clicked off this video They pretty much admitted to themselves That they are not able to be a full-time day trader They don't have the discipline, they don't have the work ethic And they are pretty much giving up on themselves But you guys were able to make it to the end And you guys were pretty much making this commitment to yourself And also to me, the hey, I'm actually going to make this shit work So if you guys were able to make it to the end of this video I have a shit ton of respect for you guys And I see a younger, unprofitable version of me Like I said, if you guys made it to the end of this video You guys aren't necessarily profitable yet But you guys are on that path and you guys have the headspace And you guys have the motivation And you guys have the work ethic to be able to make this work And this massive video It gave you guys literally everything that you guys need To be able to get started It gave you guys the mindset and the headspace that you guys are supposed to be in When you guys are getting into trading And honestly, because you guys made it to the end of this video I can already tell you guys that you guys have that It gave you guys how to build off the fundamentals How to build off the confluences And how to build off the strategy that I gave you guys within this video To be able to turn profitable We went over risk management How you guys are supposed to turn profitable with all of this new information So what I want to encourage you guys to do Is continue using that same work ethic And that same motivation that help you guys get through this long ass video That is again the goal is to help you guys turn from an unprofitable trader Into a profitable trader And go out and apply it on the charts And just like I was saying in the beginning of this video It's going to be very difficult It's going to be a struggle To be able to get through all of these lessons And all of these mistakes that you guys are going to have to make And it's probably going to take a really long time There's still going to be little holes in your guys's boat Like I was saying the goal with this video Is to be able to patch up all the big holes that you guys have But they're still going to be little holes Little mistakes that you guys are going to have to try and patch up And figure out for yourselves And again, if you guys don't want to spend the next two years Or six months trying to patch up these holes for yourselves And get a fast track to profitability That's exactly why I made the blueprint And honestly the blueprint is really only applicable For people that have the motivation That have the work ethic That we're able to make it to the end of this video That actually want to be able to change their lives Because again, the blueprint and my mentorship Isn't going to just whatever you get in there And snap your fingers and boom your profitable But I know that every single one of you guys Because you guys made it to the end of this video You guys have the work ethic And you guys have the motivation To be able to do what it takes To be able to turn profitable Just like how I did back when I was an unprofitable trader And I had to take literally years out of my life To be able to learn these skills In order to turn profitable with little to no guidance But the nice thing for you guys is you guys now can have guidance You guys can have coaches such as myself And other profitable traders right by your side So we can help patch up those little holes in your boat And instead of it taking two years, three years Even five years of trial and error Making the same mistakes over and over again You guys can come to us and say Hey, I lost this trade Why?

=== VIDEO 12/34 : Live Day Trading Losing $12,781 (I GOT F＊CKED)-57EEbYz_mcU.txt
============================================

What is up little baby boys and little girls? I hope there are no little girls watching this, but I hope there are little boys watching this because I'm going to teach you how to make generational wealth even though I actually ended up losing $12,000 yesterday day trading NASDAQ and the S&P 500. Pretty unfortunate, I'm not gonna lie because we hit, if we had won this full trade on NASDAQ, NASDAQ smoking on that gas pack, we would be swimming in bread as of yesterday. And if I didn't move my stop lots of break even on this ES trade, I would have been swimming in bread. And then I need to go ahead and show you guys the losing trade on NASDAQ. So before we get into this, let's go over what our bias was for the day yesterday. So coming into the day, coming, emphasis on come, coming into the day yesterday, let me go on the hourly team frame. Okay, so from London session into New York open, we pretty much had manipulation to the downside and then boom, we already started the, we already started the move up during London session. I high key, low key, high key, wanted us to sweep out London session highs, which were right here and then get a rotation down to this hourly order block that I marked out in blue and down to hourly equilibrium, which was also pretty close to that blue line as well. Now this ended up happening, but I ended up getting fucked on on the back end because I was just a little bit too ambitious here. So that was my overall bias. My overall bias was, I wanted to be short for multiple reasons. First reason was that the S&P 500 was right when market opened, it was already above these London session highs, but it was sweeping out Asian session highs like, built like as we were, at like right as we were opened. So I was like, bet, I'm just going to look for a five minute break of structure, which we got right when the macro hit, fucking perfect. And then from there, I'm just going to look and try and find any sort of five minute confluencees and there were a lot. There was this five minute order block, there was this five minute breaker block, there was this five minute for value gap. Now all of these things are grand and nice. My first take profit was set on this hourly order block right here, okay, and then I was also looking for hourly equilibrium. Come on, bro. I was also looking for hourly equilibrium, which was right underneath that blue line. Now again, this would have been a good trade. Emphasis on would have. If price just didn't move so violently without me. So we see the five minute breaker structure, we see the move right back into the blue line. Right back into the fair value gap, the order block, the breaker block. The first raid was on NASDAQ. It was a short off of literally all the same confluencees. Except for the fact that NASDAQ made a five minute SMT. So ES as we saw, this high was lower than this high. So I was like, this is awesome. The SMP 500 is sweeping out Asian session highs. That's one of our key levels. We already had a five minute breaker structure at the downside. We're filling in five minute confluencees and to make this even better, we get a five minute SMT. What could possibly go wrong? This could go wrong. A candle the size of Drake's penis could go wrong. Okay, we get a 60 kick, 60 tick down candle on NASDAQ and me being relatively rarded. I see this candle and I'm like, okay, well, we hit the order block and we hit equilibrium. But I'm just gonna wait for a one minute retracement because I think we're going to go lower. No TJR, no little baby boy. The second that one level gets taken out to the upside, like your key level and then the second that one of your take profits gets delivered, you should be done for the day. I did not listen to that advice whatsoever. I waited for this retracement into, I believe this was like a five minute gap. And then I entered short when we inverse this one minute gap because I was like, perfect. We got a five minute retracement and then this is going to continue us lower. So I put my stop lots above these highs and my targets were these London session lows. This was the reason why this was a bad trade was not only was the one hour bullish, not only was the higher time frames bullish, but our first take profit had already been delivered. So at that point, I'm entering into a trade looking for an extended take profit when the main area that I wanted to be delivered had already been delivered when on the higher time frame, we were in an uptrend. So boom, that happens, I instantly get stopped out. And during this time, I was like, I was like kind of calling signals on my Instagram story, but because I couldn't livestream this, I wanted to help some people out. And I'm fucking of course bro, I go two for two on the first two days of this week and then of course the one day that I go and try and help people out on my Instagram story, I get fucked on. But it is what it is because I ended up calling out this trade afterwards, which would have been much more of a win, but it is what it is. So we see this get delivered and then that's when I realize, like okay, okay, we break five minutes structure to the upside. Okay, bet, we break five minutes structure to the upside and I have already realized why I lost this trade. The one hour is in an uptrend. Our first take profit had been delivered and this is actually another key level. And then boom, we break structure to the upside off the five minute, on the five minute off of our key level. So I'm thinking, okay, let's save these people that were taking my bias on shorts from my Instagram story. We'll try and do them a favor and give them another position. Okay, so I say look, we get a five minute break of structure. These two up candles are a breaker block. You know, you could, some people consider this down candle, this black candle, an order block. Me personally, I don't really do that, but we also came into equilibrium. Awesome. What else do we have left to deliver on NASDAQ that we actually got really close to that we pretty much had like relative equal highs off of this and this right here? Well, we have Asian Session highs. And we have previous day highs all the way up here. So those were my two take profits. We get the five minute breaker structure. We get the five minute retrace into equilibrium. And into the, and into the breaker block. On this candle stick down right here, I enter purely off of this one minute up candle. There was no reason to wait for like an inverse for value gap if I wanted to. I would have just entered on this candle because we ended up inversing this. But there's nothing to inverse because we're already in bullish order flow. And this one minute swing low from swing to high. We also came in equilibrium was just perfect. Entered there, I kind of just gave like a bit of a random stop loss here. I kind of put it like at the 79% extension on the Fibonacci right here. Because I'm like, all right, look, I don't want to put it underneath these lows. Because then that doesn't give me a good enough risk reward. I'm just going to put it like a little bit there. And at this point, if I get stopped out on this, then I should retire from trading price comes up hits my first take profit. Okay, I'm able to take 50% off of the position. And very unfortunately, we see price come down. I ended up getting stopped out of break even due to spread. And then boom, right after that price goes on and rallies to hit my final take profit, which would have made me. Probably would have made me like positive 12k on the day if I hit on this. But I didn't. And then you guys will all see these me taking these trades live in this vlog that I've been filming to. So stay tuned for that. But I took the swing trade on ES as well, where my one and only take profit were. These relative equal highs we have boom weekly highs right here, start of the week highs. And then we have these highs that never ended up sweeping out these start of the week highs. So I was like, these highs are mega high confluence. We have to take these out. And I was about to get on air. I was about to board my airplane. And all of the entries, same exact reason. Okay, we had a five minute fair value gap right here. We had five minute breaker block on these two up candles right here. We yes, we already took out these Asian session highs, but I just had such a bullish bias due to these relative equal highs. I was like this like yes, we already took this out, but these highs right here are the most obvious and most easy draw on liquidity for price to go to. And I wanted to take a swing trade base on that. I wouldn't have made too much money if this hit regardless. I probably only would have made like $2,000. So it wouldn't have chipped away like too much on my loss. And I just, whatever. Same reason we get a five minute breaker structure after coming down into a key level. Have my obvious draw on liquidity right here. Five minute breaker structure, five minute fair value gap, five minute breaker block, scale down to the one minute timeframe. Okay, this one I did have to wait for an inverse fair value gap because we broke one minute structure to the downside right here for us to come down and fill in those five minute, those five minute confluences. So I wanted for us to break one minute structure back to the upside or just give me five one minute bullish order flow confirmation. So I was looking for either a one minute breaker structure or a one minute inverse fair value gap. I saw it via this one minute inverse fair value gap. Okay, I entered off of this candle inversing this bearish gap from there put my stop loss underneath these lows. And price moved up here. Once we took out these highs, I just moved my stop loss to stop loss to break even because I was about to get on the plane. And I knew I was going to lose a loose connection. So I didn't want to like potentially lose more because I was already down $30,000 and then when I hit take profit one on NASDAQ, that was at the same time as that this high being made on ES. So I was like, fuck it. I'm going to move all my stop losses to break even. I'm about to board this plane. And we'll hope for the best move the rest of my stop losses break even. I didn't take any profit on this ES trade and then boom. Unfortunately, I just stopped out of break even and then following right after that full take profit would have been hit. But then again, I'm not really crying about this because I only would have made like $2,000 or like $2,500. So it wouldn't have like been maker break for me. But this NASDAQ trade would have been a huge profit because it was a 1 to 6.8% risk reward ratio. And unfortunately on the short, I did risk a large amount. I kind of, I had like a brain slip up because we'll see in the vlog. I was doing two, I did eight lots total on NASDAQ. But I thought I was only risking four lots. So I thought I was only risking 15K. And then I ended up risking 30K instead because I thought I was doing four positions of one lot each. But instead, I was doing four positions of two lots each. Ended up biting me in the asshole. And yeah. But it is what it is. This trade would have been a far better trade to go heavier on the risk. But, amen. That's kind of how trading works. You never know which trade is going to go in your direction. And yeah, just wanted to come on here. I will not be streaming most of the time. I do do streams on all of these confluences and stuff like that. I am going to be, I have a surgery that I'm getting done. So I'm kind of going to be bed ridden for a little bit. And just staying in Miami after I get the surgery done. So I'm going to get that done. And then I'll keep you guys updated on my Instagram story whenever I plan on doing a live stream again. Maybe like I'll be off the fucking pain killer meds and like do gambling streams. That would be fun. But I don't want to be risking live capital within the market. Well, I'm super out of it. High on surgery medication and shit like that. And just like out of focus. I have to go under for the surgery too. So I just want to play it safe. I don't want to be rushing back into it. I've had a really good start of 2025 in terms of trading. So yeah, we're going to call off the rest of this week for trades. And honestly, a good time to do it because apparently today's price action was horrible. I had to go to my pre-op this morning. So I didn't even really look at price action. Yup, it looks pretty shitty. So yeah, no reason for me to even cry about missing out on today. But yeah, I appreciate you guys watching this. Hopefully you guys continue to learn from me. I love and appreciate you guys. Peace, the fuck out.

=== VIDEO 13/34 : Live Day Trading Losing $128,680 (I LOST 140K OVER THE LAST 2 DAYS)-7We6u-TW3z4.txt
============================================

Alright guys, market is about to open. Currently we're forming this high time frame. Bearish SMT off of these daily highs. Boom this high up to this high on ES this high down to this high on NASDAQ. Leads me to believe that we are going to want to target these lows. It doesn't necessarily mean that we have to be bearish today because right now actually we are making a bullish SMT divergence off of these lows right here with ES and NASDAQ. So we could see one more leg up before getting the move down that we want. However you know time will tell we could like market open and then immediately move up and take out these five minute highs or these five minute highs which I mean looks like we could potentially be doing right now and then look to target lower. That would be my preferred route for today. My preferred way of going about about today would be having price initially move up and then looking for shorts rather than looking for longs and what I'm seeing is like a high time frame bearish market right now. You know obviously target the new week remainder of the gap that hasn't been completely filled yet but right now that's kind of what I'm looking at. Yes we still have draws in liquidity to the downside but after this low there's not much that's another thing. There's not we're kind of in like no man's land with draws in liquidity. To the downside there's not much we these lows that have already been taken out by NASDAQ and then these are the weekly open lows and then we have the top of the or sorry the bottom of the new week opening gaps. Kind of a big gap between these lows and these lows right here and it's just you know it's a little bit difficult for me to want to target these things on ES you know it's pretty easy to target these lows but but on NASDAQ you know it's a little bit it's not as realistic for me to sit here and say yeah I want these hourly lows because that's a big move down. We do have a decent amount of low resistance draws in liquidity to the upside we have these highs right here these highs right here these highs these highs these highs. So it's just watching and waiting to see what price wants to do. Currently forming that bullish SMT because ES isn't underneath these lows just yet. I did take a loss yesterday I lost around $20,000 trade recap I'll go ahead and do the trade recap on this the long position that I tried to take it wasn't ideal later in the trading day as well I didn't post it on YouTube yesterday because we had that blog that went live but yeah we will see what price wants to do right now it's kind of just going sideways see what price wants to do oh oh what's up oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh where is it let me give it my chapstick chapstick I'm the government shutdown is supposed to end or is supposed to be over right? Is the government is the government shutdown over? Let's look. I think government shutdown is done right? Yes President Trump has officially signed a bill ending the U.S. government shutdown the record is setting 43- 43-day government shutdown is over. Awesome government shutdown is done. Let's look at the final statistics for the government shutdown. Five million airline passengers delayed or canceled 619 billion in new federal debt federal statistical system permanently damaged. October jobs and inflation data inflation data may never be released. Holy shit 43 days of economic data currently being delayed 750,000 thousand federal workers furloughed the current funding bill only reopens the government through January 30. Damn so we could potentially shutdown again come January 30. down All right, price is dumping right now. All right, ES, let's see the target for ES would be these lows. I mean, like I'm bearish for today. What did London session do? London session did a whole bunch of nothing, huh? Yeah, London session. Okay, so this is looking like London manipulation or leading into manipulation, New York reversal. Who knows where New York is going to reverse into? Couldn't tell you where New York is going to reverse into. But we could get a bit of a New York reversal. I mean, we have all of these low resistance highs here. Printing downcantles. So ES is definitely going to take out these these lows. There's no real like honestly for me today, brother. There's no real like strong draw on the quid. So it's kind of putting me in a sticky situation. NASA is just dumping NASA could very well come down to take out these lows. There's really no like, okay, look realistically, what are the draws on the quid for the day? Like London session highs are all the way up here. Asia session highs are all the way up here. We've already taken out London session lows and Asia session lows and previous day lows. This technically these lows down here are technically the best draws on liquidity that we can target. We have hourly highs. We have London session highs. Asia session highs. We already took out Asian session lows. We already took out London session lows. We're taking out previous day lows right now. We're taking out. I mean, yeah, it's just comparing what draw on the quid is closer and what's easier achieved for us to come up and take out this high. Which on NASDAQ doesn't really make sense. It makes sense for us to want to target these lows on NASDAQ. So the trade that I'm probably going to want to take would be a short on NASDAQ down to these lows. Yes, just took these out. This out, realistically what I need to wait for is like just a five minute retrace of the upside on NASDAQ. Monday at 11. Monday at 11. Oh, what the fuck? Monday at 11. Oh, wow. So we're actually forming a huge bullish SMT. I didn't even realize that. I thought these lows. This is Tuesday at 11. This is Tuesday at 11. This is Monday at 11. NASDAQ. Okay. Changes things a little bit but not really. Because again, the draws on liquidity to the upside are like not the best. ES is super high above these lows that NASDAQ is pretty far underneath. We would just need like the reversal to start now. Next, the next candle would have to be bullish. The next candle would have to like inverse. And then the candle after that would have to inverse this gap. We would have to see ES reacting off of this liquidity sweep. Like the second that this candle's at closes because it's 10 minutes into market open right now. Then again, there's like no good draws on liquidity. Like where would NASDAQ rather go? Would it rather go down to take out these lows or would it rather go up to these highs? These highs are two times as far. Two times farther up than where these lows are. Or are these even, yeah, these are lows. Yes, the highs are a little bit more achievable. Just a five minute high though. Realistically, the high time frame is telling us that NASDAQ wants to come down and take out these lows. Probably won't happen by the end of this week, but it will happen next week because we have that SMT divergence. And in order for the SMT divergence to be completed, we need to take out these lows. What are the stocks looking like? Videos back down, Palantir, back down, Microsoft back down, Google back down, Robinhood back down, Nebius back down. So yeah, all the tech stocks are still going down. We kind of had the dead cat bounce from that initial big move down whenever that was. I think it's hard for me to want to... This is exactly how I got fucked over yesterday as I was trying to... After we made that big dump down, I was trying to get at like trade a small retrace up. And it was stupid. It's better for us to just play within the current bias and the current trend. Wow. Wow. I mean, where's the entry? Non-existent, eh? Non-existent, eh? Non-existent entry for us? Nah, it's probably going to take out these lows. Look at this. We've just seen consistent market sell-off after market sell-off. Bro, Nasdaq can move down 200 freaking points. I mean, shit, bro. It would honestly be in our favor if Nasdaq doesn't take out those lows right now. And then we just get like a hefty five minute retrace into like this fair value gap for us to short down here. That would be like in our best interests. Other than that, like, I don't want to take... I'm not willing to take longs today. That's for sure. I learned my lesson yesterday. Yeah, I would like if we just started retracing right now. Phil, maybe this gap, I might be too ambitious. Maybe it's just like filming... So forming this five minute upcandle filling, this gap right here. Just shorting down to these lows. Just looking at crypto. Crypto looks horrible, bro. It's like the only chart that looks like somewhat reasonable. Everything else looks like shit. Nice. Okay, cool. So we're getting that retrace right now. I would just want us to... Just looking for a continuation of this realistically. We'd be like, be right back, taking a piss. Okay. Oh. Yeah, there's like negative reason for us to try and go against this move that's happening right now. Especially now is that so close to these lows. That to me is just easy low hanging fruit for us to take. The goal would be for us to just like get a break of structure to the upside on the one minute. Five minute gap, boom. Target these lows. Okay, cool. So we broke one minute structure to the upside. That's nice. Better form this five minute gap here. See if we bob up and fill it. Literally could just be as simple as taking a one minute break. Just entering on that and then trading it down to the lows like what? Okay. Just a little gap right here. Okay, we fill this gap on Nasdaq. Also this gap up here. Okay. Okay. Just like exactly what I want. I would want price to come up. Fill this gap like a big hefty five minute retrace. Because again, what draws on the quidity is price going to like what draw on the quidity would price rather get still at this point in time down to here. Or we also have a lower here stacked up super easy and attainable or up here still more than half the distance to go all the way up and take out that high. We're filling this five minute gap here. It would be awesome if we just sweep out this high right here and then boom start that rotation. Okay, we took out that high. Okay, so we have a draw on the quidity. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's see if ES inverses this. Yes, yes, inverse the gap. Let's see if we can stay patient on this for now. Let's see what we get here. Let's see what this next candle is looking like on the one minute. Now as I push past the highs, yes, it's underneath them. We get a bearish clothes might be better for us to take the trade on ES than NASDAQ. Yes, we're still monitoring these highs equal highs or no, they still look lower. Let's see how we want to close. Okay, ES push past these highs NASDAQ. We're pushing deeper into this gap. Now we might be able to make that rotation. Yes, looks good for shorts NASDAQ is looking good too. No bearish clothes yet. Okay. It's not a good close. We got to see like a fat asparagus candlestick then I'll be willing to go short here. Still nothing. Let's see if we can close properly. Yes, we're still sitting and watching and waiting. This might be it. Yes, push above these highs NASDAQ didn't. It's looking good. Got the brake. I want short here on NASDAQ. I also took a short on ES because both of these look good. Yes, it's dumping. NASDAQ is pushing this well. We inverse this 5 minute gap here. I don't really see any reason to. We're getting half the race races here now. I don't really like that. No, looking good. Stopped out of my ES trade. I'm still in the NASDAQ but real fucking close. I lost $128,680 after that one. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I bet you now is when price would start going down. It's fine. I'm still in the NASDAQ. It's funny because yesterday I got burned taking a long in this exact situation. Same situation presents itself. I'm still in the NASDAQ. Targeting these highs is just unrealistic. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ. I'm still in the NASDAQ.

=== VIDEO 14/34 : Live Day Trading Losing $25,936 (I LOST THE HOUSE)-SD0NHz-22do.txt
============================================

What's up guys? This is how I lost $25,000 day trading the Nasdaq today. Old TGR is not back. In fact, TGR is washed. I SAW at trading. But with that being said, let's get into how I found my daily bias. Why I even wanted longs for the day. And why I still low-key be thinking that we should still potentially be able to complete my daily bias. I know I sound fucking ridiculous, but I have a vision. And I think that I will be correct. Matter of fact, I might even pause this bit. Actually, no. TikTok Clippers clipped this one I'm right. And if I'm wrong, you never saw this happen. Okay? But maybe I'm just getting too married to my bias here, but I truly do think that I'm still going to be right on this. Maybe I'm fucking crazy. But let's get into how I found my bias. So coming into market open, we were hovering underneath these lows. We actually already saw London session come through and sweep out these lows. Need personally, if I look at this, we had a high time frame, a daily SMT on these lows. We can see that Nasdaq made a lower low and ES made a higher low. Okay, typically I don't use and find my daily bias off of SMTs on the daily timeframe. Matter of fact, most of the time I don't even look at the daily timeframe, but I'm thinking, look, on the weekly timeframe, we're still maintaining bullish market structure because we haven't broken structure to the downside yet. But we have tossed wicks underneath these lows. And I'll talk about that on the monthly timeframe. We are more than enough within equilibrium on the monthly timeframe. And as we know, this is a freaking index. Like most of the time, we move up. And especially if we've already gotten that big of a retrace on a higher timeframe, I would assume for us to start turning around now. But anyways, that was kind of what I was looking for and at on the higher time frames and why my initial bias was bullish. Now let's go into the lower time frames and let's look at this. During London session, like I had mentioned, we had this sell off. We took out these lows and then we started this mini reversal on London session. So we had London session sweep out of these lows right here, boom. And then we started the reversal and then boom, New York pre market opened at around 830. So I was like, okay, cool. We had London session manipulation taking out these four hour lows. And we're already seeing it reversing to the upside. So for me, I was taking a trade or attempting to take a trade towards the next draw on liquidity, which for me were these London session highs. We had London session highs right here. We had where we at. We have London session highs right here. Low resistance draw on liquidity right here. Low resistance draw on liquidity right here. Low resistance draw on liquidity right here and then previous days highs all the way up here. I obviously didn't think that we were going to go up and take out previous day highs. Okay, I'm not that dumb, but I did think that for us to want to continue down. We would have wanted London session highs. Again, I guess I kind of rode off the fact that we were in this imbalance because of me marrying that high time frame bias of a cent of me seeing that daily SMT because we're down. We're in a discount of price range right now from these swing lows up to these swing highs. For sure. And actually we're getting like slowly to the point where we're damn near invalidating that SMT and we might actually have to come down and take out these lows again for us to want to turn around because of how low we're pushing. But prior to that, we were actually within a good area like sitting sweeping out these lows. And I was like, okay, now would be the time for us to turn around. But after today's price action, especially if we continue lower, it's not going to be looking too hot. So with all of that in mind, we saw London session open. We get a sweep of these highs and then we see a sell off and then we see a sweep of these lows. And then we see boom, market start to reverse back up. So in my eyes, I thought New York was going to continue in this direction and if we put these back on, we can see that New York opened and I wanted manipulation to the downside. And we were actually maintaining bullish structure on Nasdaq, which is where I took my trade. We were maintaining 15 minute bullish structure, which for me, I was like, oh, even better. We were tossing wicks underneath these 15 minute lows. We were tossing wicks underneath these 15 minute lows. We're filling in this imbalance and on top of that, we were filling in this breaker block. And I was like, oh, dude, this is so money for long. So what did I do? I waited for the macro and on top of that, I waited for five minute order flow to start to get disrespected. And for me, that was when we pushed past what really should have been a bearish order block. Again, we kind of got a lot of things going on right here. Let me remove this. Let me remove this for now. And then let me remove this for now. Okay. So again, we had London session suite. We start the reversal. I'm expecting New York session to open, manipulate these five minute lows, which is what we did. And then I'm looking for like disrespect of five minute order flow or just five minute structure. And I saw that by us coming all the way up towards these highs. Yes, we didn't break these highs just yet, but we disrespected this order block. And why am I considering this an order block? Well, because it was the move up prior to the breaker structure to the downside on the five minute. Okay. So we see the breaker structure to the downside on the five minute. And then we come up and disrespect that order block. And then we didn't disrespect all of these breakers. We barely missed it. But for me, disrespecting the order block was enough. And also we get a retrace like all the way up here. I'm assuming that we're going to push higher. And we actually did. We ended up taking out all of these relative equal highs right here. But then ended up pushing price lower. So after seeing all that, again, not that you guys should be taking notes on any of this because I got this incorrectly today. After seeing all this, I saw I was looking for an entry. Okay, let's see where we are. I was looking for an entry after we had disrespected that five minute order block. And this was when we disrespected the five minute order block. We get one more sell off. And then what do we have? We've been inverse for value gap right here. And I'll talk about that. We get a breaker structure back to the upside on the one minute. And for me, that was good enough for me to enter because we had already had our sleep of liquidity. We were maintaining bullish structure on the 15 minute. We disrespected bearer structure on the five minute. And then we were showing like confirmation structure on the one minute. In our reality, I probably should have waited for either a fair value gap, a breaker block or an order block for me to actually confirm that entry. But at this point in time, it was already 10. So I was like, look, I'm trying to get in. I think we're going to seek out these London such as highs. Instead, we push up, we take out these pre-market highs. Should the bed down, take out these lows. Like this was just whipsaw of a day. And I think the majority of that can be due to us having FOMC minutes do at 2 p.m. Eastern time. Most of the time, I'm never really concerned about this. There's only a couple of times that we're concerned about FOMC minutes. And the last time that I was actually concerned about it was when they were talking about fund rates. And that's when it actually matters for me at least. But this time, it was pretty clear to me that when I was trading within this, I was literally just trading within a range. We can see that this was the range that we were trading within. And I ended up getting cooked in this range, lost 25k. So that was not fun. You saw price. Push up, take out these highs, sell off. And then again, this was like pretty much Wycoff's method like twice. And not that you guys need to know Wycoff's method, but essentially it's just consolidation, sweep. And then we got the first sweep and then boom, second sweep. And then boom, third sweep. This entire time we really haven't been seeking out like very valid or solid draws on liquidity. This is actually the accordion pattern that I talked about. Wow, that's hilarious. This is literally the accordion pattern that I said that the market would like never move it. But this is genuinely the accordion pattern. Look at this shit. Move up, liquidity sweep, move higher, liquidity sweep. Like this is literally the accordion pattern. Like if we were to continue like this, it would look like that. We are literally making the accordion pattern on the chart. So in unfortunate loss for me today, again, I was talking over all of my thoughts live on kick. So if you guys want to watch me talk about these trades live every single morning, I go on kick at 9 AM Eastern time. Okay, you guys can watch me live trade, follow me on there so that you guys get notifications about it. But I'm not gonna lie. I am sss. I know I sound fucking crazy, but I low key am like semi holding my bias of I want these London session highs. I know I sound crazy, but this is pretty much like a high time frame consolidation. And what we just had right here is literally what we just showed on the lower time frame that accordion pattern. Sorry, wasn't on yes, I was right here. It's literally what's happening right now that we showed on the lower time frame. Sweet with highs, sweet with lows, sweet with highs. And now we're getting close again. And yeah, looking at price action, obviously in hindsight. We shouldn't have been trading this range. And I really just shouldn't have been trading pre FOMC minutes, but hey man, PM session starts in around 15 minutes. The urge to just press long with no stop loss and no thoughts. No bias just hopes and dreams. Matter of fact, price isn't going to move down from here on out. We're taking out these London session highs. I'm going to come back to this. I'm going to come back to this. And if I was wrong, this was obviously a joke. And if I'm right, this was obviously prepared. And I knew exactly what I was doing. I'm just kidding, this isn't an actual trade set up. But I really do think we can take out those London session highs. Maybe I'm just super fucking married to my bias. But I'm using that we should fucking hit them bitches. Tell me if I'm wrong. And if I'm right, if I'm wrong, I'll admit that I'm wrong on TikTok. If I'm right, I'm going to be talking my shit for the rest of the day in all of stream tomorrow. Okay, so with that being said, I love and appreciate you guys. I'll see you guys on stream tomorrow. Wait! Before we go, it's a dead-unk-sporthy tomorrow. No, it's not a dead-unk-sporthy. Who's that dead-president? Are we allowed to trade tomorrow? Is the market going to be open tomorrow? Is the market going to be open tomorrow? Because Jordan Carter died that president? Is the market going to be open or not? Because if it's not open, I'll still stream and we'll talk about shit. I want to know, and I'm too lazy to look it up. Matter of fact, let's look it up right now. Okay, I'll get inside or trading. Is market open tomorrow? Oh, here we go. Is the stock market? Oh wait, I need to make sure I don't get docs if I open this and it tells me to like sign in with Google or something. I always be popping up with the freaking mad shit. Okay, let's see. What? The market is closed! New York Stock Exchange will be closed on Thursday. We never closed the market when King Vaughn died. And y'all are closing it for this dude that isn't even on a dollar bill, bro? Bond markets will be open, but for reduced hours closing early at 2 p.m. Eastern time, what are we supposed to do tomorrow? The market's closed, what the fuck are we supposed to do? Trading on New York Stock Exchange will be closed, Nasdaq said it will be closing trading of all US equities and auctions that day as well. There's no way this dude has that much motion. Who the fuck is this guy? Who the fuck is Jordan Carter and why is the market closing because he died? Somebody look into that shit for me. Anyways, I love you guys. We'll see you guys tomorrow whether the market's opened or closed.

============================================

What up gang unit we are back and we're black. Okay, so today I'm going to try not to trade. It's a no news Monday. As you guys can see and we're coming off of two extremely volatile days. So, extremely volatile and Thursday extremely volatile on Friday going into a no news Monday which is typically not volatile at all. On top of that, a very low, like little to no news this week compared to a news packed last week. Overall, I just think that this week itself is going to be pretty slow because we're coming off of this really big drastic move. And I'm not saying that there won't be any opportunity in the market to be able to take advantage of. But I am saying that I, like especially today because it's a no news Monday after two very volatile days regardless. No news Mondays, most people trying to avoid trading anyways. But the fact that this is a no news Monday and no news Mondays have low volatility. And we're coming off of two very, very volatile days. I'm expecting today's price action to be slow. And on top of that, I'm expecting this week's price action to be slow. I'm not saying that there won't be any sort of entries but I'm saying on the high time frame. I do think that we will be not nearly as volatile as last week and will probably just like kind of chill around and consolidate for this week until we can find some overall direction of where we want to go. Me personally, I think that this, I made a TikTok and an Instagram reel about this saying that we need to flash crash. The flash crash has happened. We could potentially go lower but I'm not going to lie. It looks like we'll probably get a decent reversal off of this point. I don't think that we're just going to have a V-shaped reversal. I think that will probably come down. Consolidate, accumulate a little bit off of this liquidity suite that we just had. And then maybe the following week we'll be able to start moving back up again. But yeah, that's pretty much all that I see. Right now we saw, I'm bearish today, whether I find a trade entry for that or not, we'll see. But we have a bullish Asian session, a bullish London session. Literally no form of manipulation on high time frames from either Asian session or London session. So there's got to be some form of manipulation for a New York session. The only draw that I could see being possible would be previous day highs right here. And then once I mark out these London session lows, and I don't even need to mark out Asian session lows just so drastic. And then let's look at the S&P 500. Same shit Asian session, up only London session, up only no high time for manipulation whatsoever. Yes, is going towards these previous day highs as well. I think the only possible trade that we could see would be an SMT divergence Nasdaq sweeps out these previous day highs. And then we catch shorts off of that. That would be the only trade idea or setup that I could possibly see. But again, today is a no news Monday. I'm going to be more risk off than I usually am if I do end up taking a trade. But for me, I'm going to need to see like right now I'm getting into the market expecting not to place a trade. Okay, so I'm getting into the market expecting not to place a trade and what was I saying? I'm down syndrome. I'm getting into the market expecting not to place a trade and I need the market to give me literally every reason possible for me to be able to be willing to take trade. Cool. Cool. Right now I'm not going to lie it's giving some pretty good reasons. If we can take out these previous day highs, it's also an hourly high. It would be pretty decent to be able to see some rotations down off of that, especially in SMT divergence. That would be pretty solid. But for the time being, we got to wait until these highs get swept. But again, I think that NASDAQ will probably sweep out these highs. ES won't be able to sweep out these highs just because of how much how closer NASDAQ is. And yeah, we'll kind of go from there. So pretty much what I'm seeing. Okay, these lows are stacked. These lows are stacked. So we have one, two, three. Low resistance liquidity and then one, two. Low resistance liquidity. NASDAQ just flipped out previous day highs. We have one, two, three. Low resistance liquidity. One, two, three. Low resistance liquidity. That we could potentially look for. Action off. But again, like I said, I'm kind of just trying to chill. We had a crazy week last week, really, really good week. So after that big week, we are probably going to try and preserve some of that capital. So yeah, what are you guys expecting from this week? Let me know your guys' thoughts. Again, because I could be completely wrong. I'm right at decent amount of the time, but I'm also wrong every now and then. We'll see. NASDAQ just swept out previous day highs. I'm just saying calm, cool, and collected here. I can finally sort of run my hands through my hair again. I'm just trying to grow this bitch back out, not back out to the long, long hair. But I don't know. I've just been switching hairstyles consistently. Went from long hair to like the short kind of long hair. And then went from that to a buzz cut. Now we got the boozy fade. Oh, man. Oh, man. Yeah. See where it big ones are. Yeah, did I talk about this? I did talk about this in the last trade recap. How we came down to fill in this gap. We have this order block right here, which is pretty enticing. Ideally, we don't trade anywhere near this low. The lowest I see as going would be potentially underneath this low. But even that seems pretty fucking steep to me. I think I mentioned in that trade recap when I was talking about this. Anything in this imbalance is a pretty solid area. Did we break weekly structure? We did, but this is on this. Let's see. Where's like the. Let's see what these drawings we're talking about. Oh, yeah. See on the official shit. Yeah, it's a wee broke weekly structure on Bitcoin. Probably going to get a monthly retrace. I don't think it will be too steep though. Maybe we'll wake underneath. Oh, damn, then. Shit, dude. Underneath that monthly low. That is kind of in line. With this right here. I wouldn't mind a little sweep of this and then a rotation right back on up. But that that's going to take some time. I think that this month will be probably pretty slow. So just like how we're going to eventually see a high time frame SMT off of these previous day highs right here for these Friday highs. Or geez, I was saying that as if it's like for sure going to happen. But just like how we want a SMT to have a high time for SMT to happen off of these highs. I would want a low time for SMT to happen as well. So right now that's not happening on the one minute. We're going to have to sit and wait a little bit longer. And again, I'm not trying to trade today. I need the market to give me every single reason to trade. Wow. If the US takes out these highs, I might as I literally will call it today. It'll hop off. Damn, bro. Yes, it's ripping. If we take out these highs, I'm calling it today. Like what? Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's actually a day for me. Yes, took out these previous day highs. I'm not trading today. Yep, literally nothing else for me to see here. GG's. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace out, bros.

============================================

All right guys So sorry for starting this so late, but right now We currently have I know that this is late, but Just gonna walk you guys through what I see we have a bear's SMT divergence On ES and on NASDAQ and I'm looking to go short on ES because it's the leading index to the downside Looking to target these lows these lows these lows I haven't entered just yet. I'm waiting for a little bit more confirmation. We did break structure to the downside on NASDAQ But all that we have right now is just this five minute SMT divergence I would low key want to wait for a little bit more of A confirmation I mean like if this fill equilibrium that could be solid. I mean Yeah, we got really freaking close there. So as long as I can just see confirmation confluence is down and out of this or out of this retrace then that would be Good, but unfortunately, we're kind of in no man's land right now. We're in this like big-ass like imbalanced price range Right through here, which is also leading me to want to be at least somewhat bullish up until these highs, but At the same time that doesn't mean that there's opportunity to trade at least down to these lows or these lows these lows and these lows which I think is very possible and you know Pretty likely low key So we're getting these moves down. I'm going to go ahead and enter short here on ES I'm I'm going to put my stops above these highs right here Because that would pretty much be invalidation of the SMT divergence And Let's see where price wants to go Setting all of these stop losses right now because I just split my positions up You Okay First take profit from me is literally just going to be as simple as looking to target these five minute lows right here And then from there we can go ahead and we have like all of these 30 minute lows that are stacked up But this would be the completion of the five minute SMT divergence So just taking profit underneath these lows would be a good starting point and then from there we have equal lows right here That would be a great point to look to take profit Nasdaq is moving off of that equilibrium, which is great These are all hourly lows that we kind of have stacked up here Yeah, and other than that this looks pretty solid right now I would I would like for price to come down and at least sweep out these hourly lows before wanting to come back up and Look to take out these highs, but bear minimum. We should be taking out these five minute lows right here That's like bear bear bear minimum So We're getting a decent retrace right now Nasdaq Didn't get anywhere close to those five minute lows It's also pretty late in the day. It's 10 20 Eastern right now And We haven't really seen much of a move like we had market open and then just give us that big leg up Because we had that big we had that gap up from the weekly open the new week opening gap was already filled by Asia session um But we've kind of just been going up only if we look at what the past sessions did a Asia session was just up only um London session was pretty much just a manipulation of these lows and then um Moves up and reversals up Again, like I said it would make sense for yes to want to target these highs But again because we had that bear issue some teos at least right now At least hoping that we would want to come down and at least take out these five minute lows Before Wanting to go higher at least give us another some form of manipulation because we didn't even get any pre-market manipulation on either of the indexes Neither of these indexes gave us any sort of manipulation during pre pre-market Um to like fuel for another Bigger leg up we had market open and then we just moved immediately up So Yeah, we'll kind of have to watch and wait we'll see if that this we'll see if this forms a One minute SMT divergence or we actually just yeah, that's another one minute SMT divergence from these highs down to these highs From these highs up to these highs But again if that isn't the overall bias for the day then Price is just going to disregard that You You All right, let's see what price does here You See if we that was like all the reversal that it wanted just taking out these lows Which would kind of suck because we were decently in profit But I will see I think looks like we're gonna get spanked. I'm not gonna lie We'll see though Especially now that the SMT is invalidated I don't know about this no more guys We'll see maybe this is the Triple top needed You Now that we created a new high Yes, we made an equal high Oh Wow no freaking way imagine You Hello Yeah, you can let him in Let's see let's see let's see what happens I love you think we're smoked on this guys We'll see though. I mean shit We very well could hit like even though we have equal highs here and relative equal highs up here Like three high stacked up and that's a super strong draw on liquidity that prices probably just going to want to go up and take out It's um You know, we could potentially go lower but I'm not too optimistic about the direction of this You It's all looking good boys You Quadruple top now we're definitely smoked Well Still not stopped out yet almost there though For real fucking close to it You Well imagine now One minute bearish has some tea on Nasdaq You know Nasdaq Imagine this is what starts it I kind of doubt it though wishful thinking we'll see Hmm Low key though it's nice because the longer that we consolidate here For me means that the deeper that we could potentially go because originally I was just looking for whatever Move up and then boom a sweep and then for us to carry this out But if we get moved down and then chop chop chop chop chop If the move is down then I'm thinking we target these lows Wow imagine this Literally look how close it oh jeez turned off Look how close it was to my stop loss Geez brothers dumbass Oh Sick also guys I took a trade on When was that On the seventh three days ago So it was on Friday. Yeah, I lost a trade on Friday I'll do the trade recap on that um Once this ends up playing out so this will be two trade recaps In one but I I lost a trade on Friday so I'm down this month actually by $150,000 I did take a losing trade on Friday And I didn't post it on my Instagram story. I'm going to post it today Um because we were doing that big event and we wanted to Whatever make sure that the Instagram story was like just On that I know it sounds stupid but from a social media perspective Hopefully you guys don't care too too much if The trade that I took is or like the results of it gets posted three days later and it's a fucking loss anyways, you know And it was a pretty decently sized one I lost $150,000 But most people that would probably Not tell anyone about it and just like go about their day but You guy like me, you know if I show my daily monthly and weekly P&L and There's somehow a minus $150,000 There's Missing from that Or negative in there that you guys haven't seen before you're going to be like what the fuck All right, dude, this is taking forever. Let's hurry this up You You Tomorrow's a bank holiday too, so Price isn't gonna move Appreciate tomorrow Just something to keep in mind You You Wow, bro, this is taking forever I might as well go and draft up what that uh other trade looked like I'm pretty sure I took it on Nasdaq I did So cool. We'll leave this S&P 500 Trade on here while I go and just show you guys What trade I took on nasdaq last Friday So The trade that I took it actually followed our strategy like to AT But because of all the bearish news of Like just the shit going on Um Ended up not being the best trade that we wanted to take so we have these four hour lows right here Then on ES we have these same four hour lows right here Essentially It was as simple as we had boom price comes down you get a high time frame liquidity sweep We have all of this low resistance draws on liquidity I was really only just targeting these highs like if we could just come up and take out these This this lowers the syndrome liquidity boom. I would have banked for the day Um, that was the target just later in the day unfortunately for me, but Um price came down we sweep high time frame liquidity Awesome. We get a high time frame break of structure Or sorry five minute break of structure to the upside and then from there we end up Coming down sweeping out these lows again um And then on ES we actually end up sweeping out these lows as well. So ES is the same exact situation except on ES Where was this day Except on ES we were far lower than where we were on Nasdaq so these were the lows that we were looking at on Nasdaq And I'm pretty sure these were the lows that ES was underneath so Nasdaq was only underneath these lows and ES was underneath these lows So I saw that and I'm like awesome high time for a SMG divergence from whatever the lows that I didn't mark out Up to these lows here on ES it's from boom the lows that I did mark out on ES down to the lows down there We get a five minute break of structure to the upside And I can't remember I took a screenshot of it or I screen recorded it but uh Let me just make sure that I know exactly what the trade was so I don't Be cabin Where's the screen recording Bro, where is it Last Friday Where the fuck is this Also the trade that we're currently in is going in our direction Where is this video? Here we go So when was this taking out 1121 Hold on let me see the current trade oh nice Give me a moment Did we take out those lows? No, no yet equal lows When Nasdaq we're not even close to them I think that that's what's going to happen where equal lows right here We took them out So I'm going to go ahead and close partial positions here And then move stop loss to break even on all of these other ones awesome. We're in profit for the day Sorry, I'm doing like two things that wants trying to explain you guys the losing trade trying to manage the winning trade Okay, so that puts me at sorry we'll go back to the last trade Damn, that's it that I mean okay, that sounds bad, but So I mean that it would be more that makes me $30,000 on the day or $29,600 on the day on that winning trade Now we can go back I'll continue keeping my eye on this, but we can go back to this Nasdaq trade 1020 so Okay, yeah, I was right here. So after seeing the break structure the upside I was looking for equilibrium to get hit from these lows up to these highs, but then unfortunately we end up coming down We end up sweeping out these lows again, but however my bias was still intact because we were still sweeping out a high time frame draw on liquidity while also making a bullish While also making a bullish divergence off of the high time frame liquidity, right? Because Nasdaq was a lot higher than ES was and Following that what do we do we end up inversing this five minute gap? So I'm like okay awesome. We get a high time frame sweep. We get a high time frame change in order flow Now I can do the exact same thing that I was doing before and I can just boom go ahead and look for equilibrium Or if your value gap and in this case we had equilibrium boom price comes down fills equilibrium We come down we fill it and then boom we get an inverse gap to the upside right here. I entered long right here I think I had my stop loss like underneath here and I was just looking to target these highs just for Like a simple one-take profit and then boom immediately got smoked Lost everything and lost 150,000 on Friday and that was the only trade that I took that week But in my opinion it was a it was a good trade and it was pretty I mean obviously I lost the trade but I can't complain because I executed my strategy the way that um, you know, I would any other day and unfortunately the fundamental news was just Not in my favor and until Trump was able to you know come back and announce like hey, you know, we're gonna have a solution to The tariffs we've stimulus stimulus checks coming through that's when the market started to rally You know versus prior to that we were in like a super deep sell off. There was a lot of fundamental news stacking up against us So now we can go ahead and look at the trade that I'm in right now I made $30,000 once this take profit got hit great stops are at break even right now. I think I can actually because we were going sideways for such a decent amount of time. I wouldn't mind extending this There's the four hour Yeah I low key think just targeting these lows is perfect We can go ahead and set The some take profits right here at these market open lows right here and then just the rest of these Equal lows right here. Let's just really Simple and easy take profit point and also it helps that Yes is the leading index because we can see that nasdaq isn't even close to these lows I think what's going to happen is yes is going to come all the way down here sweep out these lows Well nasdaq doesn't come close to these lows nasdaq will probably only sweep out these lows And then that is what's going to kick start the next leg up to these highs that We are probably going to want to take out So with that being said, let me go ahead and um Set the take profits real quick Oh All right Yeah Yes Yes Alright cool, to be completely honest with you guys, I have a lot of other shit that I need to do today and I don't, because it's like 1045 and the market typically moves pretty slow around this time. You guys know, my soft losses at break even made 30k on this drop right here. I'll be able to make a total of every single take profit gets hit. From here on out, I'll be able to make what is that? 18,000. Another 18,000 so that's 36,000. And then that's 22,000 so what? That's 58,000. And then that's another 22,000 so that's 80,000. And then this gets hit and that'll be 101,000. So if every single take profit gets hit, then I'll make an extra 101,000 on this, on top of the already solidified $29,600, you know, that I already made, so that would put me at around $130,000 win today. If you guys can't tell, I am sizing up for the month of November. So again, that's why yesterday, or sorry, Fridays loss was a little bit larger than normal. I am sizing up so expect larger swings both up and down. But yeah, that's what you guys can expect. I'll update you guys via Instagram Stories as this keeps going or I'll just wait until the rest of this trade plays out and then I'll show you guys the finalized PNL on my Instagram Story. But yeah, we'll go ahead and get this uploaded to YouTube. I'm going to appreciate you guys. Bank holiday tomorrow. Don't trade, don't be stupid and then we'll get back at it like a crack addict on Wednesday.

=== VIDEO 17/34 : Live Day Trading Making $16,320 (HOW TO GET SNIPER ENTRIES)--RAJEWMl-F0.txt
============================================

Hello folks, in honor of me making $16,000 day trading the S&P 500 this morning and it being black history month I would like to start today's video off with a tribute Emcee get on the backpack Little nigga bad bad fuck what I like that bitch Oh Everybody green Everybody lock in, everybody lock in, everybody lock in, everybody lock in, happy, black history month, I'm sorry that I didn't announce it sooner, but this is how I made $16,000 day trading the S&P ski. All right, coming into today, we had a couple of things, we had a couple of draws on La Querra. Okay, we had these London session highs. We, I marked out these just for take profit, but we had these London session highs, we had London session lows, London session lows, Asian session lows, along with Asian session highs all the way up here. A lot of people are saying, how did you find your buys for the day? This made no sense. To me, it didn't make sense either, but I still took the trade and I still won the trade. That's the, no, no, I'm playing. Okay, look, a lot of people, like I started off the stream, this is the second time that this has happened back to back, and it's just unfortunate that today, like my bias is bearish. I wanted us to sweep out London session highs and then rotate on down to take out all of these lows because I'm like, look, we have all of these London session lows down here, or London session lows and Asian session lows, and there's really not much for us to grab up here. And on top of that, on the high time frame, I was like, look, we filled in this new week opening gap that's probably going to act as an imbalance for us to want to retrace on down and continue this downtrend that we're in. So at the start of the day, I was bearish, but then once market opened, and we broke five minute structure to the upside, after getting this hourly retrace to the downside feeling in this hourly breaker right here. Okay, we filled the hourly breaker. If you want to consider this an order block, you like maybe you could, me personally, I don't consider those order blocks, but when we came down, we filled this hourly breaker, and then off of that hourly breaker, we broke five minute structure to the upside. Again, I've said this in multiple videos before, my bias will and has to change based on five minute order flow. So even if my bias is bearish, if five minute order flow, if five minute bullish order flow is getting respected to the upside consistently, that is undeniable reason for me to look for longs. Like I cannot go against what five minute order flow is saying. Same thing here on NASDAQ. Like we see boom, right when market opens, we break five minute structure. And from there, it's like, okay, yes, did I want shorts? Yeah, did we come up and did we sweep out these London session highs? Yes, we did, but did five minute order flow give us any sort of reaction off of this? No, we did it. Same thing here, on yes, when we came up and took out these London session highs, did we get any reaction out of it? No, we did it, so in turn, I'm going to look for longs. Okay, so what caused me to look for longs today and why was I able to take longs right within here? Well, it was pretty simple actually. We had that one hour retrace into the hourly breaker right here, okay, once we got into the hourly breaker, we got a five minute breaker structure. From there, once if we're in bullish five minute order flow, really all that I'm looking for after that is just some sort of continuation confidence, whether that be a bullish for value gap, whether that be equilibrium, whether that be a breaker block, whether that be an order block, and we had multiple ones. We had this equilibrium that ended up getting hit on this black candle to the downside right here. We also had this breaker block boom, right here getting hit. And then if you want to consider these two black candles order blocks you can, I don't really consider them order blocks, but we do have this one minute order block right here, which ended up getting hit as well. And then following that, okay, cool, we get a five minute breaker structure to the upside, we get a five minute retrace, what am I looking for? Either a one minute inverse pay value gap or a one minute breaker structure to the upside. We get a one minute breaker structure to the upside on this candle stick, but I'm in, my stops are underneath these lows. My first take profit was a pretty shit, shit risk for a order ratio, but I only took off a fourth or 25% of my position at these highs, which was a one, two, zero point eight risk or order ratio. And then the rest of my take profits were hit and the final risk or war was a one to four risk or order ratio that ended up helping me make a significant amount of money. So we hit first take profit, second take profit, the second take profit was just based off of these equal highs right here. I can just see it directly on the hourly timeframe. So I marked that out. This blue line right here was equilibrium from these highs down to these, sorry, not equilibrium. It was OTE from these highs down to these lows, the 62% extension. And then final take profit was just the start of this one hour fair value gap right here. And that was pretty much it. Like following all of that, we hit first take profit, second take profit, third take profit, fourth take profit and I was able to hit every single one of them. This was pretty simple. If you guys were on the live stream, where I stream every single morning, show you guys all these entries and all these exits. Obviously, like I'm not going to give you guys signals if that's what you guys are asking for, but I do show you guys every single confluence that I'm looking at prior to taking a trade. And I live stream this every single morning at 9 AM Eastern time. There's a link underneath there, where you guys to follow me, turn on notifications on kick. And also, if you guys want to learn more about all these confluences and learn my strategy and directly be my student and get mentored by me, you guys can apply to join the mentorship. There's going to be a link in the description down there. Because I know my YouTube videos are kind of scattered sometimes and some of you guys may be watching these videos and you're like, what the fuck, how was I supposed to take this trade? Well, I try and do the best that I can on these YouTube videos, but if your brain is scattered like all my YouTube videos are, then it's going to be a little bit confusing for you. On NASDAQ, there wasn't really much of a trade here for me because on ES, we actually got that five minute retrace into the breaker block and the equilibrium and all of those five minute retrace and all of those five minute continuation confluences versus NASDAQ, like we were already above not hourly highs, well yes, hourly highs, but London session highs before the macro. And that was also another reason why I wanted to go long on ES because we came up and we made equal highs on this candlestick right here. And then when we came up, made equal highs and then broke structure, I was like, okay, this is literally free bread. We have one equal high, two equal high, now three equal highs and we just closed down here. This is one trillion percent going to get taken out. Not only is it a key level being London session highs, but we have equal high, equal high and now equal high and we just close right here. This is one billion percent going to come up and get taken out. So for me, I was like, okay, bare minimum, I get like a shitty risk reward but at least I get some profit for the day. And that's exactly what I got. And bare minimum, ended up turning into max reward because again, I stuck to five minute order flow. If we see five minute break structure and then maintain bullish order flow, you can't go against that shit. Even if our initial bias was like, yeah, we wanna see a London session high get swept and then boom, rotation to the downside. Like, yeah, we can say that's what we want but if price tells us something different, we can't just get married to our short bias. I was telling this to my mentorship students a couple of days ago where I was saying, yes, a lot of times I'll come into the day saying I really want these London session lows to get taken out or I really want these Asian session lows to get taken out. And guess what? The market doesn't care what we want, the market's going to do what it wants to do regardless. It's up to us to react to the market. We are making decisions based on what the market gives us, not based on what we want as traders. That's how you end up losing trades. Cause if I say, oh, well, we just swept out these London session highs and at 8.30 when I got on the charts, I really wanted us to sweep out these London session highs, then get a rotation to the downside to take out these London session lows. But we have to understand, like, okay, the macro, it like literally already hit and we're still maintaining five minute bullet structure. That bias is probably washed by now. If we were previously embarrassed structure and then by the time the macro hits, we've already reversed five minute structure, what are the odds that we're going to come up, sweep out these highs and then get some sort of reversal to the downside for us to then come down, like there's just not enough time for that. You guys have to understand how the market moves. If the market is in bearer structure and then right when market opens, we break market structure to the upside and then we get a continuation confluence to maintain bullish market structure to the upside, literally confirming like relatively higher timeframe order flow. Why the fuck would we be looking for shorts when the macro hits? The macro gets hit and boom, we come up and we end up taking out London session highs, like yeah, obviously because we broke five minute structure and then we maintain bullish structure as price was going through. Versus if we had come up and taken out these London session highs right when market opened, that would be a different story. If we came up and we swept out these London session highs, then started rotating down and we were like, we had a potential set up to see bullish order flow get invalidated by the time that the macro was coming in opening, then cool, yeah, then I can look for shorts, but this was just too fucking obvious that price wanted to go higher. So a lot of you guys need to take that into account when you guys are looking to place trades and when you guys are formulating your bias. Again, I've said this multiple times in multiple trade recaps, you guys need to stop marrying your bias. Okay, if you guys can stop marrying your bias, then and if you guys just react based off of what the market gives you, you guys will be much better off and you guys will be able to start taking better trades and you guys will be able to start taking more trades and just win a lot more by just going purely based off of what the market gives you instead of what you want to happen. So with that being said, hopefully you guys learn one thing or two, I appreciate you guys. I'll catch you guys in the next one, peace out.

=== VIDEO 18/34 : Live Day Trading Making $16,844 (I PAYED MY MORTGAGE WITH TODAY'S TRADE)-Ut1e546gVBw.txt
============================================

Alright guys, this is how I made $16,000 day trading the S&P 500 this morning. So today was actually against my bias, but I was able to re-evaluate my bias and take this winning trade that actually ended up being super good. So the first thing that I wanted to note was that we had this big ass new week opening gap that hadn't been filled on NASDAQ and we were waiting to get filled on NASDAQ like literally all the way up until today and today's obviously the last day of the week and we finally ended up filling that. So I had a bullish bias on NASDAQ. What I wanted though, and this is kind of where my bias got flipped a little bit or not flipped, but messed up a little bit. I wanted these London session lows to get taken out and something that I didn't notice was that we had these hourly lows right here that already got swept and then caused that upward movement on both the S&P and on NASDAQ. So the entire time I was like man I want these London session lows or even these hourly lows down here and I was super set on I want London session lows to get taken out before we can go up and start looking for any of these draws on liquidity or even like this hourly order block up here which was my final take profit. But we didn't end up getting that and when market opened we can see during pre-market we already broke five minute structure after taking out those hourly lows and then following that we literally just maintain five minute order flow throughout all of this. Order flow is probably like I'm fucking I'll make a YouTube video on order flow or fuck it I'll make a YouTube video on like how I've been trading recently even though it's the same exact strategy with like just some adjustments. But order flow is literally everything. If you can look at the five minute and understand it's order flow and what's being respected versus disrespected then you know where the market's going to go especially when you pair it with liquidity sweeps so we see liquidity sweep then cool we get boom bearish order flow gets broken we start creating bullish order flow we come down into this breaker block we respect it and then boom this is when market this is actually 35 or come on this is five minutes into market open and we break five minute five minute structure to the upside and then we maintain five minute bullish order flow by closing this candle to the upside and then from there it's like okay we retrace down we fill in we fill in this five minute I mean I don't know what you want to call this is you can all call this supply and demand whatever like this down candle whatever but regardless it comes through it hits equilibrium on the five minute okay we come and hit equilibrium and then from there I'm looking for one minute entries and where was my one minute entry it was off of this inverse for value gap like it's so easy oh my god it's so easy bro oh so easy liquidity sweep five minute break of structure five minute order flow gets maintained and if we're in and if we're maintaining five minute bullish order flow you do you really think we're going to break five minute structure maintain five minute order flow and then come down and then start creating bullish order flow on the one minute again just for us to reverse down fuck no especially when we have these London session highs especially when we have these hourly highs and this was a little bit ambitious but I still held to full take profit this was an hourly order block but do you really think that we're going to come down sweep out a draw and liquidity break five minute structure maintain five minute bullish order flow respect five minute bullish order flow and then by the time that we come down here and then inverse this one minute fair value gap like what in on what earth is this going to be a bear scenario it's not it's not at all we end up boom inversing this gap awesome boom I entered off that I put my stops underneath bro this shit is so clean I put my stops underneath this fair value gap because this is really the only um this is really the only confluence that we had that was like protecting the one minute bullish order flow that we ended up forming after sweeping out these lows and then getting that inverse her value gap so I just put it underneath this gap we come down we respect this gap and you could have entered off of this if you wanted like some extra sanity or some extra clarity I was going to take profit off of these London session highs but I decided not to and decided to move my take profit up to these hourly highs just because I saw the way that Nasdaq was moving and Nasdaq was ripping and I was like okay Nasdaq's probably going to want to fill in this uh this gap from from the week from the week prior from the start of this week and if Nasdaq wants to go fill that gap then that means ES is probably going to come up and take out these highs fill in this one one-hour gap and then potentially even come through and hit this order block so I was kind of thinking like okay the high time frame we're remaining in a bullet in bullish structure we're maintaining bullish order flow we just swept out these hourly lows so I really think we're going to sweep out these hourly lows then come up sweep out these hourly highs and then rotate back down like fuck no it's just not gonna happen so we see the sweep of this we take out these highs I don't really care about it I'm focusing on these hourly highs next and then I mark out this hourly order block pretty obvious that this is the order block um and that wrapped it up for my traders super easy super simple um and again this is something that I was telling you guys in the last trade recap video where you have to be adapt to adaptable to your bias did I want London session lows to get swept out for me to be able to take longs yes I did did they get swept out no but what did we have we had an hourly low that got swept out and then following that like we have to be able to be looking at order flow and look at what price it gives us to be able to make a sound decision so like if price comes out and sweeps out these hourly lows and then like too bad so sad that we don't sweep out these London session lows that I really wanted to be swept out if price gives us a reason to go long you better fucking go long if price is giving you reasoning to go short you better press the short button not not just like because oh I'm so mad because I wanted this low to get hit and not this one it doesn't matter what you wanted okay so let's look at Nasdaq now Nasdaq didn't provide me with an entry because it just moved way quicker but it was the same situation we had these hourly lows we come down we sweep them out we get a five minute break of structure right here and then boom we maintain five minute order flow that's the biggest thing we come down we sweep out a low and then we break five minute structure to the upside and then following that the most important thing is that we maintain and get that continuation of five minute order flow per after the break of structure so we get that break of structure and then after that boom we come down we come into this order block we come into this break of block we hit equilibrium and then what do we get boom following candle up from there and then after that like boom we had already taken out these London session highs awesome where's our next target and where's the most obvious target that we wanted for Nasdaq in the first place this new week opening gap and then boom price just bull runs straight to that and that's what helped me for my bias for this S&P 500 trade because this S&P 500 was lagging behind Nasdaq Nasdaq was like already all the way to the fuck up here like by the time I was taking that trade on ES I took that trade on ES right around like 950 so when Nasdaq hit 950 it was it had literally already pushed so far past London session highs versus on ES we have maybe we didn't even come up to London session highs yet so yeah today was today was beautiful I looked at yesterday's price action yesterday's price action was beautiful as well um I'm fucking I might as well go over that with you guys too because I know a lot of people were saying that they wanted me to go over that so we can go over yesterday's price action yesterday's price action was really good we're doing extra work for you guys here so we have it's so cool to see like um people's progression and trading or I know you know what's cool to me seeing retail traders progress so much further now with the mentors that we have in the space or maybe it's just because I'm way deeper in the day trading space now than I was when I was a student but I genuinely feel like the students in day trading now are high key in a much better spot than they were when I was learning how to trade that's how I feel about all this and it makes me feel good because I'm one of those people that was able to like help the shit go and move running new May back all right lit lit lit lit this is pretty much all we need okay so this one was another pretty easy one okay we have London session highs London session lows Asian session lows London had already taken out these highs right when New York market opens we manipulate up we sweep out London session highs then what do we get our first in validation of bearish order flow which is this inverse for value gap from there what am I looking for I'm looking for some sort of continuation so what are our continuation confluence as well we have a fair value gap right here this gets filled okay from there I would be looking to scale into the one minute time frame okay we get this filled and then when we finally get an invalidation it would literally be just on this inverse for value gap right here boom it's like maybe food oops that's a long honestly I would keep my I would keep my stop loss above this above this five minute for value gap just because we get a decent enough take profit towards these London session lows to give us like to give this trade some room to wiggle um and then yeah one take profit two take profit there were there were any other like high time frame lows that we could have targeted this is like bro this is free free bread and you probably could have got you probably could have gotten a much better risk reward ratio if you wanted to play it a little bit more risky and say that okay once we got this filled and got this invert in that inverse for value gap then boom you can add drop that I probably would have played it a little bit more safe than toss it above that five minute for value gap now let's talk about Thrax pack again okay before we go before we go let me show you guys liquidity suite we're looking for following the liquidity suite we're looking for a change in bullish order flow because we just swept liquidity to the upside how do we see change in bullish order flow by either break of structure or an inverse for value gap we get an inverse for value gap following that what are we looking for we're looking for a continuation confluence confluence showing bullish order flow get respected what do we have we have a fair value gap it gets filled we scaled out of the one minute time frame and then all that I'm looking for is either a break of structure or an inverse for value gap on the one minute and then boom price just rotates down from there it literally free bands every day it's free bounds free fucking bands bro okay let's go look at Thrax pack same exact situation yes probably would have been my preferred trade for the day but same situation London such an highs like do you do you see it do you see it on its session highs let's find these Asian persuasion lows okay same situation market opens we come up we sweep out one of our key levels are drawn liquidity from there what do we get inverse for value gap from there what are we looking for some sort of continuation we have this breaker block right here we have this order block right here we also have a fair value gap right here okay price comes into the fair value yet price comes into the breaker block scale down see for me I probably wouldn't have wanted to take these shorts on on Nasdaq though because we had already taken out these London session lows but still we come down we fill the breaker we fill the fair value gap and we actually maintain bear it oh wait no no sorry we broke shut bullish we broke structure the upside right here so I would need to be looking for either a one minute breaker structure to the downside or a one minute inverse for value gap and something a little pro tip for you guys if we have because we have this bullish for value gap you're probably saying oh yeah we inverse this gap that's not enough for me if we have bullish for value got bullish for value gap I want to see the second like the the last one on the stack of fair value gaps get invalidated so yeah we invalidated on this candle right here we don't have a fair value gap right here so yeah you're either entering off of this candle right here off that invalidation maybe you put throw your stops above there one and only take profit right here free bands or you take it on the breaker structure from right here stop loss you know maybe toss it up here same situation free bands one to 1.5 wrist reward ratio one to pretty much two wrist reward ratio yes one to 2.7 eight wrist reward ratio oh play it in simple this shit happens damn dear every single day and the days that it doesn't happen you don't trade the days that you happen you place the fucking trade and you make some fucking money all right bros hopefully you guys learn from this I appreciate you guys if you guys want to see me mark the shit up live I do this every single morning at 9 am eastern time in on kick I'm literally the biggest freaking trading streamer there is on that shit so go follow and turn notifications on every single morning 9 am eastern time and if you guys want to get mentored by me learn more about these confluences learn more about how I do all of this shit and actually get taught by me coach by me for a really long time there's going to be a link in the description for that as well I love you guys I'll catch you guys in the next one peace out

=== VIDEO 19/34 : Live Day Trading Making $19,805 (TRADING IS GETTING TOO EASY)-VRGing9SiA8.txt
============================================

Yo, what's good guys? This is how I made $19,000 day trading NASDAQ and day trading the S&P 500 this morning. I could have made way more. I got a little bit greedy today. Okay, I got a little bit greedy. I made like 34K on this chop block and then I ended up giving a decent amount of money back here. But hey, at least I didn't end in like a mega loss for the week. At least I was able to make some money today, which is a big W. So we're chopping down those losses. And like I said, I mean obviously you guys see how much money that I made. We are increasing the freaking loss size. Okay, so we made, I mean, let me add it up again. I'm pretty sure it was right around 34K. 10,000 plus 14,000. That's 24,000 plus another 10,000. Yes, so 34,000 on this short. So I know that a lot of people are going to be like gambler gambler gambler. Hear me out. NASDAQ, I was bullish for the day. Okay. Up until these key levels up here, we had London Session High, we had relative equal highs here on ES. This was, I believe, PPI news data highs. So these were data highs. And then these were previous day highs. So I marked out all of those. As we know data highs are super high or super strong draw on liquidity. So we know we see, we understand that, okay, we come up, we take out London Session High and I'm like, fuck man, we got to get a retrace. We get a mini retrace here and then boom, we go up and we take out these highs and I'm like shit. There goes my bias for the day. But then out of freaking nowhere, we get this mystical magical, really awesome opportunity that I have. This is a little bit different than a typical TJR trade trade. But I was willing to take it because it was super short term. We had news coming out in like five minutes after this. And I knew that I would be able to get in and get the fuck out. So we come up, sweep out these highs, we get an inverse on the one minute. And then we make a one minute SMT. So I see that. I see an inverse on the one minute and a one minute SMT. I instantly say, I know for a fact we're taking, taking out these lows. I know for a fact that we're taking out these lows and we're retracing on the five minute. Incidentally, you're probably saying, well, how did you know that? Well, if we break structure or get an inverse for value gap on the one minute more often than not, what is that? It's a five minute retrace. So I know, okay, the one minute gives me an inverse for value gap. We have a whole, we are sorry, two low resistance draws on the quid to D and this is perfect area for a five minute retrace. So I enter literally right after this SMT stops above this high. So super tight, tight stop loss. And I know that news comes out at 10. So right here, this candle is when news came out. And I know that news was going to be high impact, okay? Go moon. Right here, inflation expectations macro impact very high volatility, very high risk level, very high popularity. Everything is high on this news event. So you're probably saying, why the fuck did you trade before news? Because I knew that if I entered off this SMT worst case scenario, I take a small-ish loss. Okay, because again, I made $34,000 on this. I was risking a little bit like I was higher risk than like a $5,000, $5,000, but it was, and it was less than $45,000 like I did a couple days ago. Okay, but it was still, it was like lower risk on my high risk end of things. Okay, I entered right here, stops above here. And I knew that news came out at 10. And I was assuming that these lows would get taken out before then. They did get taken out before then. I took partial profits. I moved my stop loss to break even and then boom, price came all the way down, sweeping out these pre-market lows. I took again more partial profits right here. And then one price left this big ass, I exited completely right here. So that is what helped me make $34,000 on NASDAQ. This is where I fucked up. I would like to say the most. Hold on. Hold on. I'm not taking another trade. I was just looking. I'm addicted to this shit. Right. I'm addicted. I'm addicted. But anyways, yeah, I forgot to show you. This was the SMT. So high right here, higher high on ES, high right here, lower high on NASDAQ. Okay. This was the dumb trade that I took on the SMT 500. This was honestly pretty impulsive. And it was because I, I coming into the day with a high time frame SMT divergence. Boom, NASDAQ making higher lows, ES making lower lows. Okay. ES was the lagging index. And for this four hour SMT divergence, in my eyes to be complete, I think we need to take out all of this low resistance liquidity. Maybe even all the way up here. Maybe even all the way up here to these. I believe this was CPI news data highs. Because these are data highs. We know that data highs are a super strong draw on liquidity. So I see this four hour SMT divergence. And I'm thinking, okay, I want not only these highs, which are our lower time still high time frame, but relatively lower time frame highs. I want these highs right here. I want these highs right here. I want these highs right here. These highs and data highs. And then I'll consider this four hour SMT divergence complete. Because again, like, yes, we've made a move up, but this is a four hour SMT just like with our one hour SMT, or with our one minute SMT that I took the trade on NASDAQ today, I want low resistance liquidity to get taken out. It's the same thought process just on a higher time frame. Price is fractal. All of the confluence that confluence that I teach happen on literally every single time frame. Okay. So with that in mind, I saw this sweep of liquidity right here, and we actually still have some potential to make this happen. I think I just entered prematurely. But this sweep on liquidity is essentially just an hourly retrace not only into this order block, not only into this breaker block right here, but also into one hour equilibrium. And we're in an uptrend on the one hour, the four hour again, we have this SMT divergence. So I was thinking, okay, awesome. We're going to come up and take out all these highs. Obviously, I was incorrect. The price doesn't just move in V's. And that's where I fucked up on. I entered off of this inverse for value gap on the one minute because I thought the volume would just like boom, instantly continue. This would be an instant sweep and then just straight up rally. That is not the case. That is not what ended up happening. And I got stopped out. I think I lost. Let me see. I lost $15,000 on this. So ending the day with $19,000 in profit. Nothing to complain about really. The only thing was just it was a little bit too antsy on this. Again, going back. I was just a little bit too married to that bias of wanting to take out these highs. I do think that we actually will complete this. I think it's just going to take some time. I think we need this hourly candle, the closed bearish. So we need like another 23 minutes from there. And then we're going to need to see some more confluence from the five minute. But at that point, like I'm said and done. I'm going to get my haircut. I'm going to the gym. I'm getting the rest of my day done because I already made my fucking money for the day. I made $19,000. Huge W. Really, really super solid to see. Anyways, with that being said, I mean, this was the Friday recap. A whole bunch of other traders from the blueprint were able to fucking crush it. Let me pull this up for you guys just so you can see what they got going on. Let me see if I can pull this shit up for you guys. So this guy, this guy has actually been super fucking consistent. Congratulations, Justice. You fucking crushed this shit, right? Wow, that is crazy, bro. Look at this. This is three months ago. He commented this on a YouTube video. At 19 years old, this is the first thing I have ever truly committed to. Wow, bro, this is making me sad. What the fuck? I've ever truly committed to and dedicated myself to by the end of 2025 or the beginning of 2026. I'll be profitable. That's crazy. The crazy thing is he wanted it to be at the end of 2025. And he already passed his funded account and he just joined the fucking blueprint, bro. That's crazy. Either wrapping up my funded account journey or already receiving payouts and transitioning to a live account on my own account. I can't wait to look back on this moment to my future self. Thank you for putting in countless hours staying disciplined and transforming our lives forever. Boom. And he just passed his funded account. He posted this three months ago, probably on probably the first day of 2025. Three months later, bro, passed his funded account. Turn 19 in September. I decided I needed to change my life for the better. Started learning how to trade and finish the bootcamp in December. Just three months later, I passed my first funded account. This is just the beginning. Wow. Beautiful. This trader again, this was yesterday, $15,000 payout. He had a $10,000 payout earlier this week. Now he's at $15,000. This guy, boom, just passed his funded account two months of profitability. Freaking awesome, bro. 17 years old and he already passed his third funded account and that's his first month in the blueprint. Before I struggled extremely past one account, now it's running perfectly. I think that proof is in the freaking pudding. Hey, this guy caught the same short. Man, huge freaking W's and look at that. Price is actually deciding to rip right on back up. I would not be surprised if Price wants to go and go ahead and take out these highs. But I'm not tripping about that. I already made my money for the day. There's no reason for me to chase anything. You know what? I might chase something and I could gamble. You know, I've been gambling a lot recently. We could place a trade right the freak now. It honestly, it will probably hit take profit. But I'm not going to do that. I already made $19,000 today. If it does go up here and hit this, then, hey man, just know I'm a good as mentor. I appreciate you guys for watching this. I appreciate all of my blueprint students. If you guys want to be coached by me and want to become my student, there's going to be a link in the description where you guys can get coached by me. Get on a call with me, myself and other profitable coaches, where you guys can literally get on a phone call with this every single day to go over your specific mistakes. I do these trade recaps. I'm just telling you guys my thought process is when I'm getting into a trade. When I make YouTube videos for you guys, I'm just giving you guys my overall feeling of what I think you guys are struggling with as unprofitable traders. But the thing that I'm able to give you guys within the blueprint is actual direct coaching because you guys, that's something that's impossible. You'll never be able to find this anywhere because you can't get it on a YouTube channel. You can't get it from anywhere else because you guys are actually having very specific problems to your own training. That's what our goal is to solve within the blueprint. As you guys can see, people are fucking crushing it within the program. I'm posting literally, literally yesterday we passed 11 funded accounts in one day, which is absolutely berserk. Again, here I can literally, I can go ahead and scroll through this from yesterday. Here you go. I usually don't talk about this on YouTube videos or on trade recaps, but I truly believe that what I'm able to do for my students is life changing and I want every single person to have that opportunity. So again, if you guys want to become one of my students, there's going to be a link in the description. I love and appreciate you guys. Have a great weekend. Cardi dropped today. W's in the freaking chat. Peace out, bros.

=== VIDEO 20/34 : Live Day Trading Making $21,415 (I FULLPORTED MY ACCOUNT FOR THIS)-xE6m4UvuT5s.txt
============================================

Hello boys and girls. This is how I made a $21,000 day trading Nasdaq this morning a bit of a little over leverage for me today I'm not going to lie I traded with a little bit higher contract size then I Or then I should have on this but ended up winning the trade so No, I'm no foul, right? You know I'm saying But let's go over the daily bias per usual I traded this live on kick with you guys Okay, so I go live every single morning at 9 a.m. Eastern time on kick there Will be a little link down in the description so you guys can follow me turn on notifications to watch me Go live and talk through all of these confluences All right, so with that being said let's go through my daily bias for the day so coming into the day I Was obviously going to be bearish and you're saying why obviously where you going to be bearish because Coming into New York session we had these London lows and we had these Asian session lows those for me were my obvious draws on liquidity After manipulating to the upside during pre-market It was just those draws on the could quit a B were pretty obvious for me especially after having this huge up leg We were super overextended. We definitely needed to see some sort of a retrace And we ended up actually getting that relatively quick and that's what I ended up trading off of unfortunately I wasn't able to catch like the majority of the move. I'm pretty sure I would have made far more money if I was able to catch the majority of the move But the lessons that I learned from last trade recap I Applied to this one and I'm not going to break my rules two trading days in a row I didn't trade yesterday because there was CPI news data We did have unemployment claims today, but it didn't affect the market at all as you can see and those came out at 8 30 a.m. Eastern time So again, and now we're before market open. I wasn't too worried about it So again on yes It was a similar situation. We had these London session lows and these Asian session lows for my draws on liquidity Now if we go into market open we can actually break down how this looks so the first thing was on NASDAQ was that right when market opened I wanted these London session lows and I wanted these these Asian session lows We immediately break structure right when the market opens for me I was not fucking with that at all and I'll talk of that on this candlestick we ended up taking out London session lows So I was panicking a bit Because this was one of my take profits, but luckily we still had this draw on liquidity down here And as we can see once we hit this draw on liquidity we've since then been going sideways But market comes down we break five minute structure we break five minute bullish order flow now I'm going to be looking for five minute bearish order flow continuation How can we see that via this five minute order block via this five minute fair value gap via Five minute equal Librium. Okay, this breaker block literally every single one of our five minute confluence is to Show continuation got hit from there I would have wanted to scale down into the one minute timeframe and I probably would have executed once we invalidated this one minute gap which was on this candlestick and On stream you guys know I was screaming because I was really pissed off that we ended up invalidating this gap before the macro. Okay, I don't really like to trade Until the macro gets hit and I've learned my lesson on this before to not trade until the macro gets hit So I waited until the macro got hit and Again, this would have given me a far better risk reward again if I entered off of this with stops I'll probably have to put these like relatively high. I'll probably just put it over this breaker right here and Then take profit at these Asian session lows would have given me a slightly better risk reward But because it wasn't during the macro I had to sit back and wait Because we made a five minute extension down. I was waiting for another five minute retrace So again, this was the five minute extension down We didn't hit Asian session lows and then boom the macro opened This was a bit of a tricky trade because we didn't have any fair value gaps. We didn't have Order block or a breaker block, but this is something that I haven't talked about on YouTube It's essentially like When this is some free game, okay, so oops Got that I have all those jobs when we're in an uptrend And we make retraces these retraces can again some people call it supply and demand some people call it in Order block. I don't really consider these order blocks But what is true about these is I kind of call these like accumulation zones Again, you can call it whatever it is I very rarely if not ever Use these but this was really the only confluence that I had to take shorts Down to what my draw on liquidity was so keep in mind I wouldn't have forced this trade if there wasn't or force this trade if there wasn't an obvious draw on liquidity that I knew We needed to take out I wouldn't have just like gone in and entered off of like a confluence is off of a confluence that I rarely take trades off of but essentially in an uptrend every single Move Down or every single move down is a accumulation range and It can be used as again some people call this supply and demand whatever and then the same thing in a downtrend which is what we were in When taking this trade Every single move up is essentially an accumulation range I use this a lot in crypto if you guys have seen me talk about crypto on stream But I very rarely use this on Invexes, but it's the same thing applies pretty much every single move up is an accumulation Prior to the distribution to the downside So that was really the only confluence that I had to look for on the five minute because if we go back To the five minute timeframe So again, that was just to give you context on what confluence I saw for like the five minute continuation So again, this looks super messy, but on the five minute timeframe We already pushed down and took out these lows, so we're continuing that downtrend We haven't taken out Asian session lows yet and we see the retrace what do we retrace up into this five minute? Upcandle right here again. You can call it accumulation whatever you want me get rid of these lines, so it looks a little bit clear again, it's super messy right now, but Talk about that so this is our accumulation candle We see price push into the accumulation candle. There was no equilibrium that was hit order blocks and breaker blocks are already up here those already got hit and there was really no fair value gaps And then from there again, this still looks super duper messy, but these blue lines I marked out both of the Accumulation so we have this one minute accumulation candle I just marked it with this blue line right here and then this was the start of the five minute accumulation both of them ended up getting hit and then from there I was just looking for Bullish order flow to be invalidated So whether that was a one minute inverse for value gap Which is what I actually took this trade off of or a one minute break of structure? That's what I would have been looking for and we made this bullish fair value gap that I was looking to get inverse and Again, if we move this over and zoom in deeply I marked out this one minute break of structure because I was talking about on stream how Since we broke one minute structure to the upside I need to see one minute bullish order flow because now we're in an in an in and up trend I'm going to want to see a one minute down trend form or at least in break of one minute structure and we can see that via either a break of structure or an inverse fair value gap So I was watching this inverse fair value gap because these lows were just really low at the time For a break of structure so we in this fair value gap to potentially get inverse and if you look super closely This candle ended up inversing this gap right here So I went ahead and took that trade with my stops above these highs right here and then take profit was That bias of those Asian session lows that draw on liquidity that hadn't been taken out yet That I was like very very confident would get taken out today. So again, there was a couple things really the main thing was just that was just talking about that accumulation Candle I very rarely use that more often than not. I'm going to be looking for Again more often than not. I'm able to take this trade but because this trade was before the macro I had to improvise and I ended up taking this one minute candle and this five minute candle Down to these down to these lows after we saw one minute confirmation So yeah that explains the trade recap and on top of that if you guys haven't been tuning into the streams do it and Please start tuning in tomorrow because trade wars has officially been announced This is what our bracket is looking like for trade wars So if you guys are on stream you guys know what this is I'm going to break it down for you guys super simply It is a 16 trader tournament Every single day two traders are going to be trading against each other and whoever is able to make the most amount of profit within an hour Winds there's a couple rules each trader has to take five trades within that hour long time frame and on top of that each Trade has to have a minimum risk of $100 per trade you guys can max max it out you guys can do You guys can try and full port the the account and oh yeah on top of that every single trader starts off with a $1,000 demo account on trading view that I will be actively tracking during that hour the hour starts at New York Market open at 930 and they have one whole hour so from 930 a.m. Eastern time to 10 30 a.m. Eastern time to take Five trades on top of that of those five trades Each one of them has to have a minimum risk of a hundred dollars per trade and who whichever trader comes out with more profit or Less of a loss than the other trader they will advance to the next round So these are our participants for this round of trade wards. We have 4k trade again if you guys know who 4k trade is He's been pretty active in the streams. He's my dog previous mastermind student is going up against Nate Then we have Ian going up against Brett. We've Simon going up against where is we have Raphael going up against I I don't know what this name is Vahulin then we have Nathan going up against Spencer then we have Moritz going up against again This this one's going to be a hard one jet that jet to a pain and then we have Diego going up against Muhammad then Joel going up against Dennis All right, and then this is going to be the bracket whoever wins this is going to go here whoever wins this is going to go here And so forth all the way to the championship and the trader that wins the championship gets five thousand dollars from me And then we'll rinse and repeat if you guys wanted a chance to be able to join this you guys should have been watching the streams Because that's where I send out the application so if you guys want the chance to join the next trade wars First of all tune into these so you guys can see how the rules work see how it goes I'll be making a full YouTube video on it. It'll be super fun super entertaining and we're going to be documenting all of it on stream every single morning So tomorrow is going to be when we get introduced to all of the traders We're going to be talking to them We're going to be doing trader interviews with all 16 of them and then we'll also be doing trader face-offs So 4k trade will be able to talk his shit to Nate Ian will be able to talk his shit to Brett Muhammad will be able to bomb Diego, you know, it'll be it'll be vibes, okay? So with that being said trade wars getting into it starting tomorrow on stream at 9 am eastern time I love and appreciate you guys piece out

May 25th of the day, bitch. Young. Huh? What? Young rich. I'm a bad bitch. Get up up. Who? I'm a poor broke man. I was in my arms. What? I jumped out the post. You ain't known now, you know? Neat. They're a poor, poor man. Bitch. Reveying my side. I'm a copy. Yeah! I may 20 fuck your rad. I may 20 fuck your rad today. What'd you do? Probably suck on a dick. Cause you're dead. Sorry. Okay. Lock in. Lock in. 25 bando's. Hey. Jumped out the bando. Jumped out the bando when I was a little last gig. For how jumped off that dick. Okay. Let's lock in. Everybody take a breather. Three, two, one. Deep breath. Deep breath. Okay. So. Pay attention. Today. The bias. Initially, I wanted a bullish bias. Why? London Session highs, Asian Session highs, relative equal highs low key. Super strong draw on liquidity, right? Right. Coming into the stream, pause. But for real though, coming onto the stream and coming into the stream, I saw this and I was like, bet. This is my draw on liquidity for the day. This is my obvious target. However, what I failed to consider and what I failed to think about was that the market doesn't give a shit about my bias. And we have to adapt, react, re-adapt, and act based on whatever the market gives us. And what did the market give us right when market opened? A fucking SMT ski. Okay. So. When that happens, am I marrying my bias of wanting to go long to take out these highs? No. I'm saying, hey market, thank you for telling me not to go long today and not for being a retard. And thank you for telling me literally exactly what you're going to do because now I'm going to play you like a fucking flute. Okay. So. Why did my bias. Change from bullish to bearish. Well, it's fucking obvious. There was a bearish SM fucking tea. We see the bearish SMT right as market opens. ES makes a lower high. NASDAQ, NASDAQ, smoking, hunch, you're fucking ass crack. Makes a higher high. Following that, what am I looking at? I'm like, okay, what is five minute order flow currently? Awesome. It's bearish. How do we know that? Well, it's right here. We broke five minute structure on this candle stick down. We maintain five minute bearish structure while forming an SMT. Boom. Five minute breaker structure followed by five minute confluence. What's next? Like literally, what's next? You just wait for a one minute breaker structure. Or a one minute inverse of rally gap. We got the one minute inverse on this candle closure. I answered a little bit late on this. I entered at perfect time on my live. This was on the funded. And another reason for why I thought it. Why I thought it. Another reason for why prices going to go down. Not only did we make a five minute SMT. Not only did we break five minute order flow. Not only did we maintain five minute order flow. After this many move up. And not only did we get a one minute inverse of rally gap. If that wasn't enough. Obvious reasons. We had relative equal lows right here. I know these are one minute lows. However, relative equal lows are relative equal lows. Especially when we're forming a five minute bearish SMT. Especially when we're already in bearish order flow. Especially when we just get a freaking inverse of rally gap. Especially when we enter into the macro. These lows were obvious draws on liquidity for the day. Now did I take profit here? No. My first take profit was all the way the fuck. Over here it was hourly lows or actually it was four hour lows right here. And then following that, I had a whole bunch of other draws on liquidity. It was pretty much just all of this low resistance liquidity. We had hourly lows right here, four hour lows, four hour lows, four hour lows, four hour lows. Or actually these were hourly lows. But pretty much all of this is just low, low, low, low, low, low, bro, boom, all of this. Low resistance liquidity. Now, if I wanted to, I could have held to full take profit. However, both on my live and the funded, first of all, the funded had like some bullshit as rule. I guess I didn't pass the funded yesterday. I thought I did because I hit the profit target again. This is my first funded account challenge in like the past. I can't even remember the last time that I did a funded. But this has been a fucking minute. So I guess I'm too good at trading and one of my trades made like too much money. So now it's telling me to make more money to prove that I'm like actually the best at trading. And it says that I have to like split it up into two or more trades. So whatever, this one I made, I think it was like 3.4K on this. And then tomorrow, as long as I win the trade, I should be able to pass the shit. So yeah. But on the live account, I took profit right here as well just because I was up $25,000. So yeah, today was pretty fucking simple, bro. Even though I know the stream was super butt hurt because they were like, you said your bias was bullish. I did say my bias was bullish. But I also was screaming at you guys. I literally screamed it. I literally screamed 5 minute SMT ski on NQ. Like just because at 9am, I say, oh yeah, I want these highs to get taken out. Doesn't mean that's where a price is just going to go for the day. We have the way for price to fucking move, bro. More often than not, my initial bias at 9am is wrong, bro. More often than not, my initial bias at 9am is like fully incorrect. But I'm really fucking good at adapting and reacting to what the market gives me. And that's exactly what I did today. We saw 5 minute SMT, we see a 5 minute break of structure, we see a 5 minute SMT. Sorry, I already mentioned that. And then we get a 1 minute inverse for value gap right when the macro opens with relative equal lows right here on the lower time frame, while also being in 5 minute bearish order flow. It's fucking obvious where price wants to go. It's fucking obvious. And again, I could have held to all full TPs, but the profit was already good enough on the live. I wanted just to take the 25 bands to the bank. One of my up, I'm up 40k on the week, 15k on Monday, 25k today. Up 3.4k on the funded. What are they going to say? What are they going to fucking say? So, yeah, bros, this was a solid trade on ES. There was no reason for me to look for a trade just because this was the, or this wasn't lagging index, Nasak was definitely the better one to trade. It was literally, that was the cool thing about Nasak today. It was literally waiting for everybody to get their entries in, bro. Nasak was literally fucking waiting for everybody to get their entries in. Like, it was just consolidating, consolidating. While ES was shitting the bed. ES is shitting the bed while Nasak is going sideways. What do you think is eventually going to happen in Nasak as it's literally generating low resistance liquidity right here? As it's literally forming a 5-minute SMT, as it's giving every single confluence to go short. While ES is still shitting the bed. What the fuck do you think is going to happen in Nasak? It's going to go fucking down. So, that was the trade that I took today. I know it was a bit, you know, it can be frustrating. I understand that when you're on my stream and I say, yeah, I want price to be bullish. But, don't, like, when I get on stream and I say, yeah, my bias is bullish for the day. That isn't just a straight oracle prediction of where price is going to go. And you guys should definitely know by now that when I get on stream and I say what my bias is, more often than not, like, my bias is, well, I mean, it can either go one or two ways. I'm either right about my bias and boom, the draws on liquidity gets hit and then boom. Everybody's like, holy shit, you called it. Or, my bias is incorrect. And I still take a winning trade because I'm able to adapt my bias to what the market gives me. And you guys really need to start learning how to do that shit too. So, that being said, fucking W. Oh, wait, yeah, I know you guys are going to fucking bitch and scream about this shit. But, it's probably the last time that I'm going to do this bitch, just because you guys are fucking me eaters and you guys get the point by now. Oops. I mean, I'm going to do 25,000 dollars. I don't know why it doesn't. Oh, yeah, there you go. That's a little bit better. But anyways, 25K on the day. And yeah, G fucking G. I'll see you guys on stream tomorrow. Hopefully, oh yeah, we didn't have any high impact news, so no need to worry about that. But, a W day for the best day trader that is fucking gay.

============================================

All right guys, let's get into it. So first of all, Monday, government shutdown is officially over. The longest shutdown in government history is officially over. So some things that we need to look at coming this week. We have FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday. We have unemployment rates coming out on Thursday. This actually, believe it or not, most of the time unemployment rates don't really affect the market too much. I think that unemployment rates at this time will end up affecting the markets because we haven't had this news data for the past month and a half. So that's just something to keep in mind. Today, we don't really have any news besides Trump speaking at our own 6 p.m. Eastern time. And that's pretty much it. We were supposed to have CPI news data last week, but the government shutdown didn't give us enough time. So it looks like CPI is going to be, when did they want to schedule this? Here we go. So December 10th. Wow. Oh my, yo. This trading day is going to be insane. Look at this. We have CPI news data. And then we have interest rate decisions. Yo, FOMC interest rate decisions, as you guys know, the past two times that I've traded this, I've made $400,000 or more. And we have CPI news data right an hour before market opens. Absolutely insane. So December 10th, big day to look out for. I also have money on the interest rate decisions. I think that we are going to decrease rates by 25 bips. We'll see how that goes. That's just a fun little prediction that I put on. But now going into the markets today, now this is something that I think all of us can be pretty conscious of. I'm overall bearish. Not only the last time we made a weekly low, we broke structure, but we also just inverse this weekly gap. We broke structure last week. I wouldn't say safe to say, but I think we're due for some more bearish movement. I think that ES is going to want to go down target these lows and these lows. I think NASDAQ is because we've already taken out these lows. We're filling in this daily gap right now. I think that we can look for us to move a little bit lower. And overall, I've been high time for bearish on equities and all of these things. For the past couple of months, I feel like Michael Burry just wanting to short the market over and over and over again. Obviously, it's hard to do in a market that consistently and historically goes up and to the right. For the most part, especially when we're dealing with these stocks that have just been up only. For the last fucking seven months, but we're finally starting to get some catalysts that are causing us to want to look to the downside. Now, going into today's daily bias, we have this is the open from Sunday. We have a London session sweep of these highs right here and we're getting a sell-off down to already Asia Session lows right here. Now I would like for us to remain bearish. We're already underneath Asia Session lows. The only reason why I would like to remain bearish, even though we're sweeping out Asia Session lows, I would want probably like a high time frame retrace. Maybe we get some legs up that comes through. You know, sweeps out these five minute low resistance highs here. But I want to target these lows down here because looking at the chart, this is high resistance liquidity. We just came up and swept out these highs and we're coming down to take out these lows. And realistically, what's a better draw on liquidity for us to look at? Even though it's a little bit farther down, we have these lows right here on the S&P 500 and then these lows right here, two high time frame low resistance lows, two high time frame low resistance draws on liquidity. And then on Nasdaq, we only have these lows right here. In my head, I think that this draw on liquidity is slightly better than us wanting to come back up and sweep up these highs. When these highs itself were a sweep of these highs that caused the liquidity sweep. So orders were already filled up here. I don't think that we're going to want to go back up and sweep out these highs to fill more orders to push down, especially because the overall high time frame bias is bearish. I think that this was the sweep required for us to move lower. So what I want is just simple sweeps of these low resistance highs on the five minute. Markets about to open in one minute. I just want to see us come up and manipulate some five minute highs up here. And then I'll just be looking for a price to go lower on both of these indexes. We do have some five minute lows right here. These are really the next draws on liquidity that we can look at before targeting these hourly lows all the way down here. But yeah, I think that this month will stay closing bearish and hopefully maybe the following month, like what it's November right now, I hope this month can close bearish. And then I hope December closes like a disgustingly bearish close as well. Or maybe just half of December we get like a big sweep down some sort of news catalyst that causes us to go down and sweep out all these lows here. And then for us to continue on this high time frame massive up trend that we've been on for these stocks and indexes so far. But I do think that a high time frame retraces something that's low key like necessary. Now yeah, so market just opened. I'm really just looking at these stacked up highs like all of this just trend line liquidity doesn't really matter which one it wants to stop at. We can look at all of these highs here. That's mainly what I'm looking for. If price comes all the way down to take out these lows, then I personally won't trade because my I mean, we'll see, we'll see, but I just don't I want to take shorts down of these lows and none of these high time frame lows. I don't know if we can get all the way down to these high time frame lows, but potential. But this is a London's London manipulation reversal. We're looking for New York continuation essentially. So we're continuing there right now, but I would want us to come up and sweep out some of these low. Lower time frame highs first and like give us like an hourly retrace maybe because realistically, I don't really see us wanting to climb up to these hourly highs to sweep them out just to push lower. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think these like where we are right now here down to here 15, 15 take move here up to here 74 take move. You know, I don't really out rather short down these lows makes more sense to me. So we'll wait, we'll see what the market wants to do. And then we can move based off of that. I know a lot of people have been asking about crypto recently. I mean, we're in this, I mean, this green box for me has just been like in my opinion, like, yo, like the green box is green for a reason. I'm not a financial advisor, but personally, if we were to get, on another leg higher here on Bitcoin, right here would be the place that it would happen in my personal opinion, like this movement looks exactly like this. We have boom, we have a high, a wick above the high, big sell off, and then rally. We have a high, a wick above the high, big sell off. You know, we could get a rally here. That's what I see could be completely wrong, but personally, anything for Bitcoin under $100,000 or just, you know, yeah, in my opinion, anything under $100,000 is for me personally, I would want to take that. To each their own, I'm not a financial advisor. No clue what this chart's going to do. I've been buying this entire move down. So yeah, we'll see. We shall see. So right now we're getting that move up, which is nice. So both these indexes are coming up. We're taking out some of these highs now, which is great. So on NASDAQ, we're getting more of an aggressive move up. We're taking out these five minute highs. We took out these five minute highs. Yes, we haven't quite got above any five minute highs just yet. I would want to see, I mean, yeah, any sort of manipulation to the upside would be nice. But yeah, we're just going to sit here watching late. As price does its thing, I think that my bias is going to play out. I do think that we're going to get the sweep of these highs. We're getting it right now. Yes, it's above these highs. I mean, it's the most, in my opinion, it's like the obvious play for today. It would be sweep of these low resistance highs and then sell off to come down, take out these lows. That's what I'm looking for. We'll wait, obviously, until optimal time frame to be entering. Because obviously, we could, we're taking out this high time frame low right now, right? And we're breaking five minute structure to the upside. However, again, do I think that us sweeping out this high time frame low is going to cause a big enough sweep and a big enough orders to get filled for us to want to target these hourly highs? No, not really. I think that us taking out these lows is just going to cause for a one hour, a one hour retrace. So maybe we fill in this hourly gap or it's just as simple as us coming into hourly equilibrium, which we're already in. So like we don't even have to move any higher than we already are right now on either of these. So from this hourly high down to this hourly low, ES and NASDAQ, we're pretty much already at equilibrium. Like bet we can start the rotation down now. I don't think it's going to happen right now. But you get what I'm saying, like we don't have to move any higher. So yeah, we're taking out these highs, taking out these highs. And yeah, we're just going to sit, watch and wait. Good legs up here. Yeah, coming up to take out these highs would be fire on one of the indexes. That would be, I mean shit, that's pretty high. We're already filling in this hourly gap. We just filled it on NASDAQ. I don't really need us to go any higher than this. We can, obviously, on ES, we just would have to push past these highs right here, which we just did. So awesome. The hourly gap has been filled on both ES and on NASDAQ. I mean shit, bro, if NASDAQ wants to take out these highs, we can form a awesome bearish SMT divergence. If ES doesn't take out these highs, we're ripping right now. NASDAQ swept out these highs. ES is underneath these highs right now. I mean shit, bro. Maybe NASDAQ wants to come all the way up and take out these hourly highs. I said that I didn't think that that was going to happen, but now here we are all the way up here. So potential now. Holy gap. What the fuck? Yeah, there's a missing candle here. Whatever. It's about to be 940 Eastern. So my eyes are on these highs right now. NASDAQ swept these out. ES hasn't. So my eyes would be on if we're going to get a bearish SMT divergence from these highs down to the highs on ES, because NASDAQ swept them out. Or if we want to push even higher to take out these hourly highs that I didn't necessarily think we were going to take out, but now we have potential to. My eyes is still bearish because we've taken out all of these lowers. All of these lowers, this is draws and liquidity. I do think these highs are kind of, they're like out of the way. There's like a big gap. See how these highs are like smoothly stacked up. There's a bit of a gap from here to here. And it just depends on if NASDAQ wants to come up and like has the orders necessary to come up and fill that. If it does, and if it does take out these highs, then yeah, NASDAQ's definitely going to take out these hourly highs. But I'm kind of, I'm looking for this SMT divergence to happen. And I'm just looking for downside. Pay attention to this because we could get this SMT divergence right now. We haven't formed any sort of one minute structure for us to like, like we just have up only on ES, ES would be the index that we're trying to trade on because it's the one that's leading, not lagging on the SMT. We don't really have any one minute structure yet. So I want a low to get formed because in order for me to even consider a trend change on ES, we'd have to inverse this gap all the way down here or break structure all the way down here. So we're going to need like an up candle on ES. But right now we're looking good. It's 9.43. We'll see how this five minute candle closes. If we can close bearish on these candles, then that SMT will be confirmed. It could also get a one minute SMT divergence here as well. And as that is above these highs, ES is underneath these right now. Okay. So we got two bearish SMT divergence. Bearish SMT from these highs up to these highs. Bearish SMT from these highs down to these highs. Low key just waiting for one minute confirmation. We're going to be willing to short. We are pretty close to these highs though. So we did take them out on Nasak though. I would honestly low key want ES to come up and take out these highs. And Nasak is close to these hourly highs. So it's kind of tough to say right now. Like these hourly highs are kind of like objectively better. Especially where we're at right now. Like what's an easier draw for Nasak to come up and grab these highs. And for Nasak to come all the way down here to grab these lows. It's four times the distance. Right now it would be for Nasak to come up and grab these highs. Okay. And ES just pushed above these highs. So I would want ES to grab these highs. My bias is slowly flipping bullish here. As time goes on and as we get closer to that entry time, which is like literally three minutes away. And as we're not getting really any sort of like bearish confirmations. Okay. So ES just swept out these highs. Nasak it looks like we're just going to come up and take out these highs here. If Nasak this is kind of what I would want. The Nasak to like not take out these highs before my high like literally right here. And then give some sort of like fake out or some sort of like break of one minute structure to the downside. And then the look or what I would want to be taking would be long up to these highs here. I didn't think that market open would have this much of a bullish push, but it is which is fine. Just making me readjust things. So what I want now would be for Nasak to start like a move down here. We inverse this one minute gap here. Come down maybe sweep out these hourly or these one minute lows. ES to inverse this gap here like we're getting. Because again, just looking at this like I would want ES to sweep out these lows. Maybe sweep out these lows and then we can look for higher because. I mean we've an hourly draw on the quid to be right here versus an hourly draw on the quid to be right here. What realistically makes more sense for us to target these highs. If we come up and sweep out these highs. It's hard to say that I would want to be like looking for anything special at that point. Did we take out these five minute highs here? It looks like we did. We took out those five minute highs. Maybe that like mini liquid be sweep is what we need to get a five minute retrace lower and some sort of manipulation down. But yeah, I mean if we take out these highs just like I said earlier, if we take out these highs we're going to take out these hourly highs. Didn't expect there to be this much bullish movement. Wow. Off the open but those stocks man, I guess they don't go down. It's 9.50 now. So I still don't think that we're going to want to target these highs all the way up here. I do think that that is super unrealistic. I think we're definitely not going to trade out to these highs. I think if we sweep out these highs without any sort of down action beforehand, okay, so we just did that. My bias is going to have to be bearish here. I don't really see us. There's no real high time frame draws in liquidity that I would want to be looking at other than these highs up here, but these are high resistance draws in liquidity or this is a high resistance liquidity. We want to be trading away from this in my opinion. So I, again, when I started this, I said, hey, I don't think that it's possible for us to trade up to these hourly highs. Boom. I was proved wrong. We did trade up to these hourly highs. Now because we're above these highs, I would want to see some sort of bearish SMT divergence. We've got to start seeing some bearish action here from Nasdaq off of these highs and from ES underneath these highs to start rotations down. And that's what I'm going to be looking at right now. So if we can start bearish rotations now after that high time frame sweep, that would be what I'm looking for. Focus on ES. If ES can inverse this gap, I'll take shorts. Made a new low. I don't know what this big ass gap is. Oh, that's the weekly gap that I marked out. Okay. So the all I'm looking for here is just downwards movement. We have a five minute gap right here. New low right here. I'm looking for one minute downwards movement or downwards confirmation. We have this five minute gap right here. This right here is like a determining point. So if we can break structure to the downside here, I'll look to short and then the determining point is going to be this five minute gap. So if we break structure to the downside here on the one minute, which I think will do, once we get into this gap, I can move stop to break even. Okay. So once we get into this five minute gap, so again, if we break structure here, then I'll short ES because it's the leading on this high time frame bearish or some T-dip virgins. So if we close like this, I'm shorting ES and then once we get into this five minute gap, I'll move stop to break even, which will probably be like somewhere around here. Because if we want to go higher, then whatever, we'll go higher and we'll react off this bullish gap and we'll push higher. But if we want to go lower, then we'll inverse this gap. And then I might even go even heavier in. So we have even broken structure to the downside yet on either of these. I think we're going to. I honestly could go short right now. Probably wait a little bit. But that's kind of what I'm looking for. I think regardless, we're going to, if we fill this five minute gap, then we're going to have to wait, unfortunately. But damn. We get into this five minute gap. Yes, I want NQ. We're getting in this gap. But the nice thing is, if we inverse this gap on the five minute, if we inverse this gap on the five minute, then that's just like, sure, sign. So we filled this five minute gap now. Okay. We have a minute 50 left for us to see what we do with this five minute gap. If we want to bounce out of it and push higher, awesome. I don't think that's going to be the case. We're getting retraces up now. We're missing a candle here. I don't know why it's been doing that. But we filled this gap. And focus is just, are we going to inverse this? Or not? Let's see what happens. Are we going to inverse this gap? If we do, bet. I'm short. So we can go right now. As that we're underneath it. Yes, we're playing within here now. We're playing within it. So if we inverse this gap, I'll be looking to short. It's down to the wire here. 13 seconds left. 10, 9. How are we looking on the close? So we didn't inverse it. On NASDAQ we did. That gives me more of a reason to want to go short. Just means we'll probably get a little deeper retrace here. So NASDAQ we inverse the gap. That's good. Means we'll probably just get a five minute retrace. Maybe NASDAQ will come up. So we've got these one minute highs. Oh, lies. Yes. Not loading in this candle. There we go. OK, so we just got a pretty big retrace here on ES. I wouldn't mind shorting once we get bearish confirmation out of that. Yeah. Good retrace here on ES. So a little bit patient. Watching weight inverse this five minute gap. We have the SMT divergence. Just watching and waiting right now. Making a one minute SMT divergence from these highs up to these highs right now. So if we close bearish on yes, then we're looking good. The unfortunate. I mean, it's not really unfortunate. But NASDAQ seems to be leading and it's closer to these draws. So I kind of want to favor NASDAQ here. NASDAQ is closer to these draws. Going to go short here on NASDAQ. Target these lows is first take profit. Even though NASDAQ is the technically the lagging index on the higher time frame SMT, NASDAQ is just closer to those draws on liquidity. It's leading to the downside. And on NASDAQ, we were able to inverse the gap. So gives me a little bit more faith. I think that NASDAQ is going to want to take out these lows here. So. OK. So I took partial profits there moving my stop loss of break even that puts me up 51,980 bucks on that stop is that break even now on NASDAQ. So it took partial positions here. I just kind of need to readjust myself and think about what other take profits we could do. There's not really much for kind of in a free fall zone. So like low key, shit, bro, we could dump down at these lows here. This is like the five minute order block and breaker block like lined up with these one minute lows here. So we're looking good. This could be a big day. Yes, took out these lows. Take profit. Take profit to will be here. Take profit three will be down here. Don't necessarily think we'll come down and take profit three, but never say never. Already we're already in profit for the day. So that's all that matters. Chipping away at that kind of ugly. Ugly monthly balance that we're at right now. I think that puts us only down a hundred K or a hundred grand on the month now. We were previously down like 150 K. So that win was good for me to take. I mean, I think that we'll be able to continue this trend here. Because we inverse this five minute gap, just broke structure of the downside on the five minute after sweeping out hourly highs. I think that we can continue this lower. Look at that hourly sweep, bro. This is perfect. Again, this was high resistance liquidity for the day. I think that this is good. That was a good trading day. No complaints. That was super fucking locked in going into this week out sick of shit last week. I'm still kind of coming off of the sinus infection that I had. But coming into this week ready to fire, ready to go. Everything's looking good here. We want to monitor this one minute gap here. We get a bearish clothes like this. And if we take out these lows here, I don't see any reason for us to not want to come down and grab these lows. That would be good. That would probably be a six-figure day for me. Same thing here on ES. It's looking good at here, bro. It's a beautiful trading day. It was locked in. It's a big day. This will be a big day. This will be a big day. Let's grab those one minute lows. We can get these lows. Yeah, come on. Yeah. Let's maintain this bearish structure here. Fill this gap. Fill it lower. See what we do off of this one minute gap right here? If we inverse this, then we'll probably come up to fill the five minute gap that we have right here. We don't really want that, but that would be the case if we end up inversing this gap here. Or we fill it and then we continue lower by inversing whatever like this one minute gap down here. This is the five minute gap on ES. Now, Zach, we're still in that one minute gap. We'll see if the one minute inverse is this gap here, then we'll probably see price come up and sweep out these highs. Four moves lower. I just hope that on that move up, we don't get stopped at it. Break even. That wouldn't really be too happy. But we're still playing within this gap. If we can inverse this one minute gap to the downside right here, we'll probably continue this trend and take out these lows and these lows. They're stacked up. I still think that these lows are highly probable. I just hope that we don't get a retrace up to stop me out of break even before coming down to take out these stacked up lows that we have right here. If we or no, we would have to inverse this gap right here. Gotta see what we do off this one minute gap. Okay, so we have an inverse yet. Ah, damn, ES, we reversed it. Doesn't mean that now Zach's going to come all the way up here and fill this five minute gap. And that ES reversed it and NASDAQ didn't because that probably means that ES will want to come up, sweep out these one minute highs to fill the five minute gap and then push lower. This is showing that NASDAQ wasn't able to inverse this or we just go straight down from here. Yes, inverse this gap. If we can inverse this bottom one, then we'll continue the trend lower. Same thing here on NASDAQ. Obviously, if we inverse this gap in these lows, I think I'm guaranteed. And then from there, I'll be willing to move my stop loss like above these highs once we take out these lows. So, yeah, ES, we have a possibility for us to fill this five minute gap up here. NASDAQ is looking a little bit weaker, which just again makes me feel better about the position that I'm in because I don't want to get stopped out of break even when I still am super sure of these lows getting hit eventually sometime within the next 30 minutes. I would like to see ES fill this five minute gap. Since we're in bullish order flow on ES, we have these lows that we could, you know, if we break structure to the downside here, then awesome. We can continue this move down. NASDAQ looks good. NASDAQ, we're still in bearish order flow because we haven't broken structure to the upside or inverse this one minute gap up yet. It would be nice to see just price dump right now. We're getting there. Let's see if ES just wants to say fuck you and break structure here. That would be fire. Nice. Come on. Break. NASDAQ looks good. I think, yeah, NASDAQ will be able to take out these lows when we get my sugar ready, so I can partial. Come on. Let's break structure there on ES. Nice. We broke structure on ES to the downside. Just hope we can continue. Let's move down now. Nice. Yep. Such a strong, strong liquidity right here with this low stacked up with this low. Yes, we're looking good. NASDAQ looking great. Yeah, we're gone. Take them. Let's go. We're going to take them. Let's go get it. I'm ready to close partial. This will be big, big day. If we can get this sizing up for the month of November, I've already told you guys this, but nice. Come on. Let's smack it. Let's smack it. Got it. Okay, close partials there. Wow. Great day. About $119,870 now. Floating $70,000 in profit so. Good day. Good day. Man, good damn. Locked in. Okay, so. See here now. Yes, was unable to take out these lows. I low key think that. Or we'll have to see here what happens, but. We're maintaining one minute structure here on NASDAQ. I still think that we could potentially come down. I mean, this to me is looking like, you know, four hours sweep of these highs. What are we going to do? We're going to continue this trend all the way down. Like, I could very well. I'm probably, I'm not going to, but I can hold this all the way down here. I don't think that that's going to get hit today, but I can hold this to all the way down here. To these lows. It's possible. I might end up doing that. I think that we have the legs required. I think that that's possible. This could be a big day. I mean, it already is a big day, but. I think that we can take out these. As well. My break even is like so high up here. I'm in such an advantageous spot right now. If we just continue this bearish one-minute structure, if we continue the bearish five-minute structure, means the invalidation point would be these highs up here. If we break one-minute structure to the upside here, then that will probably tell me that ES wants to go and sweep out the highs that it left up here and maybe fill in that five-minute gap. What will probably happen is if we get a break of one-minute structure to the upside. Now we can look at these highs. NASDAQ, we can look at these highs. If we break structure here, what will probably happen is one of the indexes will sweep out these five-minute highs, probably fill in this five-minute gap. Looks like we're about to break it right here. So, if and when we get this break, we have these highs that are stacked up on the indexes. We have these highs that are stacked up on the indexes. Awesome. So we broke structure to the upside. Cool. We'll probably get a retrace, sweep out of these highs, maybe fill this five-minute gap here. And then when we get that, I'll just be looking for even more of a continuation. Because now ES has this low and this low stacked up and this low stacked up. We've got three sets of lows for ES to target. NASDAQ, we already took out these lows, but we have these lows all the way down here for us to target on NASDAQ. So right now, what I would be expecting would be for us to sweep out these five-minute highs up here. Sweep out these five-minute highs, maybe sweep out these one-minute highs up here, fill in this five-minute gap, and then continue the downtrend. So we're going to get rid of these take profit points because we've already used them. And since we're in one-minute bullish market structure, it's really just as simple as monitoring the one-minute structure. Again, just like how we've been doing, just seeing, okay, awesome. If we inverse this one-minute gap here, we're probably going to go lower and then we're probably going to want to take out these lows. I think that we're going to want to take out these highs first. So that's what we'll be looking at. We're looking at these highs. These highs right here, that's marked out with the fair value gap. Same thing here on ES because we broke Shusher to the upside. We're looking at these highs, these highs, and then this five-minute gap. And then for us to break back down, it would just be to inverse this one-minute gap to the downside. And ES could set up for a great short opportunity here. If we inverse this gap, then for me, I see obvious draws right here. So NASDAQ, we just inverse this gap to the downside. I would rather see it on ES because ES is leading here to the upside. But NASDAQ inverse this, so that to me is saying, okay, we're going to continue this five-minute trend down and probably target these lows on NASDAQ. If we can inverse this gap on ES, I think ES, it's almost guaranteed that we're going to take out all three of these lows here. It's something that I would literally be willing to put money on. But I'm already up so much for the day. There's no reason to take another trade. But I mean, we're seeing it happen in real time right now. If we inverse this gap, these three lows consider them fucking gone. So gap, inverseed on ES, these lows, I think are smoked. Unless we want to push higher here. Because we're kind of stacking up low resistance liquidity here. But right now, five-minute bearish trend is still intact. Five-minute bearish trend on ES is still intact. If all these stacked up lows, probably make a one-minute retrace and then smack them. Five-minute bearish trend on ES, I think are smoked. Five-minute bearish trend on ES, I think are smoked. Five-minute bearish trend on ES, I think are smoked. Five-minute bearish trend on ES, I think are smoked. Five-minute bearish trend on ES, I think are smoked. Five-minute bearish trend on ES, I think are smoked. Okay, so let's see here. If we want to come up, what will probably happen is we'll probably end up sleeping out these highs. That's going to be like a key point. We'll be these five-minute highs right here. If we break structure of the upside on the five-minute, then that's when we'll probably have to say, all right, we could end up going a little bit higher here. This big move down that we've been trading on. We capitalize off a bit, too bad so sad. This is kind of a key point right here. Ideally, what we do is we poke our head above these highs like we just did on NASDAQ. Ideally, we come up and sweep out these one-minute highs. Then we just hit a smooth swift rotation down. Oh, beautiful. ES just came up, swept up these highs. The goal would be for us to again push above these highs, fill in this gap. Then boom, just turtle head, our shit just for us to go lower and all dude, beautiful. Literally, you could... Can't make it look better. That's exactly what we got right there. Now, we would want this to continue down, obviously. What are we doing? Exactly what we did before is just looking for. Again, the five-minute trend is still intact. We haven't broken structure to the upside yet on the five-minute. On ES, we didn't break structure to the upside on the five-minute. We're continuing this bearish trend right now, as long as we don't break structure, as long as we don't inverse this five-minute gap here. So, we would be looking for us to continue the five-minute trend, and how do we know that the five-minute trend is going to continue by us flipping and changing order flow to the downside on the one-minute. So we'll be looking at this inverse gap. We'll be looking on Nasdaq for us to inverse this gap here. And if we get that, then I definitely think that we can do... We're in for a big one. I think that we can target these lows, these lows, and these lows. So let's see what happens here. We could also just get a break of structure if we form this as a low. Okay, so we form this as a low. If we get a break of structure to the downside, that would be good as well. If we break structure here, I could pull off a crazy play. I could move my stop loss on this position to above these highs, enter again, and then have the stop loss of this entry be above these highs. That would still mean if I get stopped out of both positions, I would pretty much end-break even. We'll see what happens, but that's kind of what I'm thinking we'll do. We don't get it just yet. Yes, we're still in that one minute gap. If we break structure here on Nasdaq, that's probably what I'll end up doing. Because I think that we can still go lower. Great looks right here. So clean. I've been broke. The way that I've been pinpointing price action today has been ridiculous. I said that we wanted to sweep out these highs. I said that we wanted to fill them as 5 minute gap. Target these lows. Oh my goodness. So nasty. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. Yes, we're taking out these lows. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. I'm going to have to go lower. If we can break past these lows, I think we just fucking free fall down to here. Same thing here on ES. I think once we can break past these lows, it's just we're going to take these lows. It's a matter of if we can get past these lows here, this barrier. Just looking good on ES. Now let's see if we just break past these lows. Nice ES. We got underneath these lows. I think we fucking free fall. We can get solid closures underneath here. Nice bro. Let's go. Oh my god. ES took out these lows. Now because this is the bearish SMT divergence, ES is technically the leading index for us to complete this SMT, it wouldn't mean that ES has to take out these lows. If that's the case, then yeah, we're going to go lower. And I think we are. I think we are. I think we're just going to go. I think this is like that move down. I think that was the catalyst. I think we can dump. I think we can dump down here as long as we are whatever trying to get as long as we can break out of this little consolidation that we were just in that we were playing around in. Then yeah, I think we can go. Nasdaq we got to get lower here. But yes, yeah, these lows would be the completion of the SMT divergence. And now it would be like the completion of the move. I like for us to not stay within this five minute consolidation. I would like for us to get out of this. I was taking these lows with the first step. I was like actually, you know, we got the breakdown. We're re-tracing up into that consolidation. I would like for us to get the firm move. But we'll see. Okay, let's see if we I moved my stop loss on Nasdaq to above these highs here. So making a big retrace back into this five minute consolidation range. We're still maintaining bearish five minute structure on. Yes, and on Nasdaq on the five minute again in order for us to see the one minute change back to the downside. We just need to see an inverse of this gap. Yes, we just need to see an inverse of this gap. We're going to go to the bathroom real quick. See what press wants to do. All right. So let's see if we inverse this gap here on the one minute. Yes, same situation. Or we could form it up candle and then break structure to the downside either or. I do still think that we have. I'm pretty fucking confident in these lows getting taken out on ES. I do think that that's possible. It's just, I mean, I guess it's just like a matter of when. It's watching and it's kind of hard because I mean now stop losses above these highs. So it's a little bit more possible for me to get stopped out. But like I don't know. I don't really want to sit on here for too much longer. Just talking out price action if we're just going to continue going like staying within this five minute range. Let's see what price wants to do here though. This could kick start the next move down. There we go. So if we break structure here, then this will be next move down. And I think you know, the volume of this candle, I think that we're ready to go and potentially ready to just completely break out of this five minute range that we're in finally got enough liquidity for us to dump here. Let's see if we can actually break structure though. That's the key thing that we would be looking for. We got the break on NASDAQ. Got the break on ES. I would like to see us just dump now. Next stop for ES would be these lows. Same thing here for NASDAQ. Next stop for NASDAQ would be these lows right here and then these lows. ES, I would like to say that these lows are guaranteed because it's the leading index on the SMT divergence. And for us to complete the SMT, then we would have to we would have to hit these lows. NASDAQ. It's hard to say that these are guaranteed. So I'll be watching ES and watching NASDAQ and seeing what price wants to do. But yes, I do think that we're going to grab these lows. It's a little bit closer compared to where NASDAQ's at right now. NASDAQ, the move down is a little bit steeper. First we get those lows. So I think what I'll probably do is if ES wants to come all the way down here and grab out these lows, then I'll just close my NASDAQ position once these lows get taken out on ES or if these lows get taken out on ES. But ideally, we get out of this five minute consolidation and just fully make that move up. Come on mate. Just go down Go! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Go! Pfft! Hello! Pfft! Make the dump! Now's your time! Come on guys! Let's stop playing within this dumbass range and just dump it down. You know you have to come on! Continue this one minute trend. Come on, you want these lows? Nice! Come on bro! Take the lows! It's just waiting for a huge candle bro. Now let's get this one and then this one. You already got this one. Oh my days! Pfft! Pfft! Continue the one minute trend and not just keep flipping back and forth. Please! Nice go! This has to be it bro. Make it happen. Boom! Let's go! All the way now. Now that we got these lows now everything's possible. Now that we took out all these lows everything's possible. Now we can open up the floodgates right? We're just going to go straight down now. Straight down. Let's go straight down. All the way down. Just straight black candle six down now. Floodgates right? Boom! Dump it. Dump it. Yup! Dump it dude. Dump, dump, dump, dump, dump. There's nothing else in your way ES. There's nothing else in your way. All that we want is these lows now. I mean one second there's going to be somebody on my door. I need to sign some papers. I'll be right back. Keep an eye on this. This is really quick. So we had no plan right now. Yeah. Should've been one. Now we'll be... No. No, we'll be... No, we'll be... No, we'll be... No, we'll be... No, we'll be... No, we'll be... No, we'll be... No, we'll be... No, we'll be... No, we'll be... No, we'll be... No, we'll be... No, we'll be... No, we'll be... No, we'll be...

Let's fucking go. Great freaking trading day today. Man! $317,572.90. I'm done for the day. What a freaking great trading day. Holy shit, man. And I could still hold for even lower. But no, I'm completely satisfied with how I traded today. Man, what a freaking awesome trading day. Phew, dude, that was so locked in for all of that. Literally a two-hour live trade recap with you guys. Completely like I was so on point from literally the entry up here to the end. The entry up here to the entire move down. I was like perfect with my analysis of where price was going to go at what time. With every single small movement that I was making on the low time frames. I could not be more satisfied with the way that I traded today. Man, what a freaking awesome day. Cool, that's going to finish it up for me. Appreciate you boys. I'll catch you guys tomorrow. I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye.

=== VIDEO 23/34 : Live Day Trading Making $401,280 (I FULLPORTED FOMC)-7a8tAGkVJac.txt
============================================

What's going on guys as you can tell by the title of this video I Made 400 in $1,000 day trading FOMC and I did it while on a fucking airplane So this is going to be a bit of a trade recap what I would have done differently Number one never trade on plane Wi-Fi ever again You guys will see in some of the screen recordings that I show because I was screen recording the entire thing It was around an hour and 30 minutes worth of screen recordings But I wanted to make sure that you guys got full transparency and Literally every single inch of proof possible for this trade because I knew that it was going to be a crazy freaking trade Because I was planning on risking a lot I told you guys beforehand that I was planning on risking a lot So I wanted to make sure that I was able to capture the entire thing before we get into this trade recap If you guys haven't already guys I'm doing a three-day live event for you guys. This isn't no buy my course fucking thing Okay, this is literally just a three-day live event that I'm doing for every single one of you guys and it's going to be Probably the best piece of content that I've ever put out to the internet Imagine like the boot camp but with my updated way of trading my updated Dated ways of thinking about trading updated psychology updated risk management as you guys know I trade a lot differently than I did two years ago when I made the boot camp personally I would like to say that I'm a far better trader now two years later than I was when I made the boot camp And I know how much you guys love that whole series and that whole YouTube thing that I did But just being open and honest with you guys the boot camp is dated, okay? I do not trade the same way yes I use the same concepts. Yes I am thinking about the markets in the same way But I'm trading differently my strategies different my confluence is that I'm using are different my mindset is different There's some days that I'm actually willing to trade on now that previously in the boot camp I said not to trade on and I think that's where a lot of you guys, you know Kind of get it twisted where that's the one thing that kind of sucks with YouTube is I'll make a video saying Oh, don't do this and that video could have been you know two or three years ago And then what do you know two or three years go by guess what I'm going to become a better trader I'm going to become also a better teacher at trading and Maybe I'll look back on that video and be like damn. I was wrong There's some things that I looked back on in the boot camp And I'm like this actually isn't the best way to go about doing these things and In turn, I want to making an updated version of this for you guys and that is this three-day live event There's going to be a link down in the description for you guys to sign up It's going to be three days. It's going to be live you guys are going to be able to ask me questions It's going to be multiple hours per day and it's going to be over the weekend So you guys have literally no excuse but to show up. This is happening next weekend Okay, so it starts November 8th. Okay, so you guys have eight days to sign up I would love for you guys to be there. This is going to be a one-time thing This isn't going to get re-uploaded to YouTube It's only for people that are showing up and going to be on time to this because again I really just want to make the most of this Opportunity to be able to give you guys an updated version of how I'm trading and then also reward the people that are willing to put the time in because I'm going to be going in-depth on different things that I don't necessarily have time to go into during YouTube videos that don't necessarily warrant a full YouTube video for it but are very very useful and Some things that you guys definitely have to be taking into account when it comes to trading like psychology stuff Like some confluent stuff Specifically risk management stuff specifically fundamentally new stuff We'll touch on some of the stuff that I'm going to get into in the combine on like the new stuff today But there's just like way more information that I have now that sometimes just like gets left out of YouTube videos Or doesn't warrant a full YouTube video to get made about it because one it'll hurt the YouTube channel by You know not getting views and not getting pushed because it's such like a tiny little thing but also it's It's something that there's just no reason to make a full YouTube video over such a small concept But that small concept could be a turning point for you guys is trading and that's what I'm doing within this three-day combine So long story short three days straight. It's live me teaching you guys first days probably going to be like five to six hours So you guys are really going to have to lock in we've spent probably like the last two months working on this behind the scenes And we just started talking about it now It honestly kind of sucks that we just started talking about it now because it's so late and it's so close to the event I wish I had more time to talk about it and get as many people in here as possible because I know that this is going to be so great And I've actually already had people who've gone through the slides and the presentations and all of the content that I'm planning on doing They were like bro holy shit Why haven't you been promoting this more and I just I don't know I've just been so locked in on working on this for you guys and I haven't been working on promoting it Which kind of fucking sucks But that being said if you guys want to sign up to this three day live event It's going to be a link in the description for you guys to sign up to that now Let's get into the craziness of yesterday So there were two Three significant news events that were happening yesterday first was interest rate decisions Okay, so we already knew now give me one second here I'm going to pull something up We already knew that interest rates were going to get cut and you're probably saying well How did you know that interest rates were going to get cut? I was using this handy dandy tool called polymarket So let me go ahead and pull this up if you guys don't know what polymarket is Polymarket is essentially a third party platform that allows you to Try and predict what is going to happen in the world. So again, it's like making predictions It's prediction markets. Okay, so you're making predictions on what is going to happen in the world And there's a bunch of bunch of these things I don't want to go too deep into it because we're just trying to focus on the trade at hand here But we can see that it's talking about when will the government shut down and people are making bets on that the feds decision in December so this is what I was using to my advantage but for the feds decision in October, okay, so how did I use this to my advantage? So yesterday this was saying October Okay, FOM's FOMC and their decisions in October and This was pretty much a 99% chance that the Fed was going to decrease rates by 25 bips So you're probably saying well, how is this random prediction markets site giving you alpha on the charts? Well, I'll tell you about it and I've talked about this on stream before and I talked about it I think in a previous YouTube video or maybe it was a coaching column the blueprint, but regardless This is such an important tool because we can literally see what the masses are thinking about big decisions that are coming up and See if these big decisions are already getting priced into the market so yesterday before we had interest rate decisions like getting announced there was already a 98% chance that the Fed was going to decrease rates by 25 bips That means the vast majority of people were already under the assumption that the Fed was going to decrease rates by 25 bips and it was almost guaranteed that the Fed was going to decrease rates by 25 bips or at least that is what the mass majority of people were thinking was going to happen into the market now with that being said if we go into the market and we look at the Price action prior to that news event that was supposed to come out and we look at what happened from Monday Tuesday leading up until this Wednesday decision. Oh, would you look at that? Markets were pumping and what do we know what happens typically when the Fed ends up decreasing interest rates? The Fed when it they decrease interest rates that typically causes the market to go higher because again lower interest rates Just means bullish economy, right? So we can see that on Monday we gaped up here and then we started trading higher not only did we have interest rates that were going to be affected but we also had a federal chairman Powell speech, okay? So the first thing that was already getting priced into the market was the fact that hey the Fed is probably going to decrease rates or is More than likely going to decrease rates by 25 bips boom on Monday and on Tuesday. What was everybody doing? They were buying into the news. This is all going to translate into the trade that I took on the plane in a little bit But this is things that you need to understand so you guys can understand my thought process on this So again Monday Tuesday people were buying into the news because again, there was a 98% chance or at least 98% of the people were under the assumption that hey The Fed is going to decrease rates and this is going to be a bullish catalyst for the market so that on Wednesday at 2 pm Eastern time when this news hits the market people are already knowing what that news is going to be the second news catalyst that we had on Wednesday was federal chairman Powell he and he was speaking 30 minutes after the Fed's interest rate decision which came out at 2 pm so federal chairman Powell was getting on stage at 2.30 pm after interest rate decisions at 2 pm and then the last big thing in the market was earnings, okay? We had Google Meta and Microsoft all have their earnings Meta actually did not end up beating their earnings Google ended up beating their earnings as we can see gapped up massively this morning and Microsoft I Microsoft beat their earnings but ended up trading down now again Polymarket they have something here for this which is earnings we can click on this tab and again We can see if we scroll through here so previously on Wednesday we had Google Meta and Microsoft so on Wednesday There was a I believe it was like an around all three of these guys pretty much had around an 80% chance of beating their earnings So on Google 80% of people were assuming that Google was going to beat their earnings Google ended up beating their earnings and then boom price ended up ripping Meta 88% of people were under the assumption that Meta was going to beat its earnings They didn't beat their earnings and then price ended ended up tanking Microsoft there was around like a 82% chance that they were going to beat their earnings They did end up beating their earnings but even though they beat their earnings price and ended up going down now you're probably saying again How is this going to be beneficial for us to be able to understand this going into the market? Well all three of these massive tech stocks that realistically are driving the entire market right now the vast majority of just to give you guys Perspective 80% of the stocks and the S&P 500 were down I think it was either yesterday and there was only 20% of the stock so 80% of the 500 stocks that compiled the S&P 500 were read but the 20% That was green ended up causing the S&P 500 to be up over 1% so these massive tech stocks the stocks that are driving the The mass majority the market cap within the S&P 500 and within the NASDAQ are Pretty much the market movers right now and these three are specifically Some of the big ones. So that's why that's important but on top of that People were under the assumption. I know today we already know the what had happened to these earnings But all three of these had an 80% chance or what 80% of the people were under the assumption that all three of these Tech stocks were going to beat their earnings we can see that that was already priced into the market So on Monday, what did they do they gapped up people were under the assumption that Microsoft was going to beat its earnings and That people were buying before earnings came out on Google People were under the assumption that Google was going to beat its earnings as we can see from Friday going into Monday What happened price gapped up and people were buying all the way through Monday Tuesday and then boom when say it comes out They beat their earnings by a lot boom price ends up skyrocketing meta people bro This is crazy. This is exactly what I'm talking about here People were under the assumption that meta was going to beat their earnings meta ended up gapping up But then when meta loses and ends up losing their earnings boom flash fucking crash and now we're all the way down here down 12% on the day and honestly this is a pretty good investment opportunity But I'm not a financial advisor. I have no clue what I'm fucking talking about but Those I know have been rambling, but those were the three big big big massive news catalyst that were driving this entire I guess you could call it FOMC or whatever trade that I was taking on the plane So with all of these things taken to into account us already being under the assumption that the Fed was going to cut rates by 25 bips the vast majority of people thinking that Microsoft meta and Google were going to beat their earnings and then federal chairman Powell speaking at 230 that leads us into the long awaited trade recap So this is essentially what I was seeing coming into this So this red line represents when the Fed decided to cut rates or when the news came out that rate cuts happened at 2 p.m Nothing happened Literally nothing happened there was one tall candle that ended up sweeping out low time frame liquidity right here But this was not significant. We swept out these highs and then just went side went sideways and actually luckily for me Bro right when this came out my phone did not have connection for around Seven minutes so at around 207 I was able to get Connection to be able to even see what happened to the market and I was actually freaking out because I thought I didn't have the chance to be able to trade this and Luckily we didn't do anything off of it and again Why why did we do nothing because of polymarket because the vast majority of people 98% of the people had already bought into the fact that We were going to get that decision that decision Everybody knew that that was going to happen so that decision didn't cause a drastic move Whereas if we go back and we look at like meta for example People thought they were going to beat their earnings So what happens when the decision is actually the opposite of what the vast majority of people think boom flash fucking crash And it's going to cause the market to go crazy But because the market because people were already buying into this news event and pretty much under the assumption That interest rates were going to get cut and they already knew what the decision was going to be at 2 p.m Nothing happened. There was no high time for him liquidity sweep nothing So that leads me to waiting for federal chairman Powell's speech So federal chairman Powell got on the pulpit at 1430 right here at 230 and I had marked out and I'll go ahead and pop up the Screen recording again. I'm trying to be as transparent as possible with you guys here I'm going to pop up the screen recording of me marking out the box box here on The S&P 500 and then also me marking out the box here on Nasdaq Okay, I marked out these Levels of consolidation Okay, I marked out these levels of consolidation because we had boom the FOMC decision Everybody already saw that and then we were going sideways We were pretty much creating an area of accumulation Before federal chairman Powell got on the stage federal chairman Powell gets on the stage on this candle And then whatever he says his greetings and then boom Instantly says something extremely bearish now I marked out This box and then as you guys will see on the screen recording I Put on two different paths that the chart could go I put a path that with like the little arrow tool that we would either break out of this box come up and sweep out these highs and then go lower Or we break out of this box go down sweep out the hourly lows over here and then go higher Okay, now you're probably saying well we broke out to the upside and then we went down yes That's true however when we broke out to the upside We didn't take out any of these significant draws on liquidity We didn't even sweep out FOMC highs. We actually broke to the up or didn't even break to the upside It was just like a fake out to the upside But where did we actually take out significant draws on liquidity? It was through the downside we took out draws on liquidity down here We took out draws on liquidity down here. Okay, that is what the sweep was and that is what I based my trade off of Because I needed a high time frame sweep of liquidity for me to take a trade So you're probably saying why didn't you take shorts? Well initially I wanted to take shorts today because that was my assumption I thought we were going to come through sweep out these highs and then go down and then target the the new week opening gap that we had But that wasn't the case we ended up making the high time frame sweep to the downside So as you guys will see in the screen recording when I pop it up I'm constantly writing oh, I need these highs to get taken out for me to take profit Oh, I need these highs because these were the significant draws on liquidity to the upside after we had taken out the significant draws on liquidity To the downside. So once we ended up moving down That's when I ended up entering into long positions once we broke structure to the upside right here That's when I started entering into my lungs. So that was the first trade that I took I ended up entering into long positions Right here. I entered long right here. I had my stops underneath these lows Pretty big stop loss, but I wanted to target all of these highs up here Okay, that was my first trade and then I'm going to go ahead and pop up The screen recording one more time as we fast forward through time here I marked out this inverse or potential inverse gap and I I'll again on the screen recording You will see that I said if we inverse this gap I'll enter long again. So we ended it ended up inversing that gap I went long again right here boom and then I ended up moving my stop loss underneath these lows and then moving my stop loss from these lows down to these lows Because we ended up making a five minute retrace. Let me go over how I exited this trade first. So we have two entries right here with our stops now underneath these lows We have one entry right up here with my stops underneath these lows At this point in time we were kind of going sideways. I knew that I wanted these highs. I kept Squiggling my freaking cursor over it. I'll pop up the screen recording of me saying I need these highs I need these highs that was my overall target for the day I wanted these highs to get taken out. That's why I have this green box here I wanted those highs to get taken out. Okay, and the entire time I was like this looks great We took out the high time frame draws on liquidity to the downside. We broke out of it. Things are looking good This is exactly what I expected we get this inverse gap here. However, I got super fucking spooked Because we ended up making a five minute bearish SMT divergence from these highs To these highs while on the SMP 500 we had these equal highs right here down to Bro, and I'm so I'm so fucking good at this dude. I'm so nasty down to these highs When that SMT divergence was formed and when notice I still have this marked out I made sure to keep the majority of my drawings on here just so it was easier for me to remember but Once we made this SMT bearish SMT divergence and once we inverse this gap on the on the SMP 500 so at 1528 I closed out of that first trade on Nasdaq. Okay, I closed out of that first trade on Nasdaq and that trade I really did not make that much money on that trade. I was only able to make around 32,000 dollars so as you can see whereas So I ended up closing All three of those positions so the two entries right here and then the one entry right here on this candle right here So this entry I ended up losing money because I was in drawdown I probably ended up closing down here, but both of these entries I was in profit So I ended up making a small amount when off of this Now onto the next thing that I that you guys will notice in the screen recording I actually pre predicted this bullish SMT forming now I was spooked of the bearish SMT I wanted to get out with some profit and then just re-evaluate everything that was going on So after that bearish SMT I still wanted those highs and I even I wanted those highs even more because the SMP 500 Now had equal highs on the five-minute time frame and then also low resistance highs on the five-minute time frame And then what did I notice? I saw the SMP 500 come down sweep out these five-minute lows And then make lower lows while on Nasdaq We did not sweep out those lows in turn making a five-minute SMT divergence okay We ended up making a five-minute SMT divergence So these were the lows that swept out these lows on ES And we made this five-minute SMT divergence again I'm going to pop up the screen recording of me writing out possible SMT divergence If ES sweeps out these lows on my trading view while I was on the plane Predicting that this would happen I actually I thought it was going to happen on this move down But it actually happened on this move down but regardless I was still able to predict that there was going to be an SMT divergence off of these lows Now once we created that SMT divergence Bro, this is when I went right back in so once we broke structure to the upside on this candle right here Oh max longs again. I ended up going Taking three long positions with my stops underneath these lows with my targets being these highs Okay, I entered into three long positions right here With my stops being underneath these lows and my target being these highs up here And then the rest is really history because we had that five-minute SMT divergence the entire time I really wanted these highs Really freaking bad we ended up getting them and actually broke funny enough I was panicking because price came up right here. I'll show the screen recording of it price came up right here swept out these highs and After we swept out those highs I was like fuck we started making candle sticks down and ES didn't sweep out these highs and I was like oh no It's an SMT dive. It's an SMT divergence. It's a bearish SMT divergence These are the only highs that we're gonna take out price is going to actually end up going down now And I didn't have fucking connection. I was trying to close my trade out right here And I didn't have connection for like three or like two minutes And so I'm just watching and waiting and then I finally get connection back on this candle and I'm like bro now Now like I don't want to close because I'm so much lower from my take profit point So I was like fuck it these high time from highs haven't been taken out these FOMC data highs haven't been taken out yet Taken out yet I'm just going to sit here and hold and then price ends up ripping up hitting these highs and then once we hit these highs Again, I'm fucking panicking. I'll show the screen recording my trade locker Isn't reloading. I don't have Wi-Fi. I'm reloading. I'm reloading And then while this is happening I'm trying to close out my trade and then price ends up ripping all the way up here hitting full-take profit and I'm actually able to close all the way up here and like top-taking it And then as we can see right after that price ends up dumping down. I got respectfully I got really fucking lucky with that exit I probably should not have made as much money as I did on this trade by being able to get out up here when I did but Shout out to Delta Wi-Fi when they ended up working I'm never going to trade on a fucking plane again and that pretty much gives you guys the full entire trade recap of how I made 400 and one $1,000 on FOMC I'm going to pull up my trade Zella here now for you guys so you guys can see both of The trades that I took it's going to be split up into multiple positions But you guys will be able to see what I'm talking about here. Let me just get signed in. So this was the trading day October 29th all right, so these were the Want these were the six positions that I took as you guys can see so this was the losing trade that I mentioned Both of these were the winning trades that I mentioned trades LF factors in fees included So it's a little bit different numbers than what gets shown on my trade locker But it's the same. It's just the fees included So if you look in the top right hand corner if you guys saw my Instagram story You guys will see like the the fees and shit and you can just add that or subtract the fees from the overall balance But anyways, yeah the loss that I took it was around $30,000 the two wins that I took it was around $25,000 and 35,000 so giving me around like a Whatever that is like a 32k Win ish right or less no like a $30,000 win and then the this was the last trade three positions All ended up hitting full-take profit. I wonder if there's and then okay overall On the month still down $26,000 but it's um a much better Much better way to close out October than how it was looking previously again Amen, I guess maybe I should just start trading FOMC every single time because I'm two for two now But I'm not gonna lie like I again last FOMC I came in with the plan this FOMC as you got as I showed you guys like I came in with a plan I was using the data from polymarket. I was looking at people pricing in the feds interest rate decisions I was looking at people pricing in the earnings decisions and all of those things went into the the trade that I took It wasn't just you know willy nilly see what is going to happen, but yeah guys that pretty much sums up How my trading day went all try and get this uploaded as soon as possible for you guys and yeah Hopefully you guys enjoyed this video. This was Crazy crazy crazy trading day if you guys haven't signed up to the three-day live event do it There's a link in the description that being said. I love and appreciate your boys. Peace

=== VIDEO 24/34 : Live Day Trading Making $64,214 (I RISKED WAY TOO MUCH)-zU8XCP_cp3U.txt
============================================

All right guys, market is already open and it's pretty much playing out how I want to currently We have a high-time frame bullish has some T-divergence from These lows down to these lows on NASDAQ and then from These lows up to these lows on the S&P 500 We've had a pretty steep sell-off throughout all of London session I'm expecting New York market to eat back up some of those losses that Have happened overnight and during pre-market. I'm expecting a lot of buyers to come in on Friday because we've had a super steep sell-off on all of these indexes and on all of these stocks All these stocks as we can see they gap down all of these tech stocks have been kind of tanking the last week And it's been providing true for honestly good entries You know seeing a big monthly retrace candle like this. This is actually pretty optimal on companies like Nvidia Palantir Robin Hood Metta Google I mean barely on Google Holly Baba like all of these big AI tech stock companies that are getting these big retraces down It's it's nice to see that we're finally getting retraces, but Whatever that's correlating to the stock market right now as we can see we have a pretty steep sell-off from Last week and this week on Nasdaq as well We finally took out these daily lows that I wanted us to take out and I think that we will just continue lower I really think that we can come down and I think I Mean I don't know I think my final take not take profit of my final targets for this overall retrace on Nasdaq or the S&P 500 is right here these These previous all-time highs. I would love for us to get that big of a dip and I'll just continue dollar cost averaging into my S&P 500 and my Nasdaq positions again We kind of do have this high time frame low resistance these high time frame low resistance draws on the quid Do you stack up? And Nasdaq was just able to pierce this low so that's like the first step and then you know if we take out this low Then it's kind of looking like okay, we might as well take out these lows too And then once we take out these lows and boom we're retesting all-time highs And then I think we'll be set up pretty good for 2026 or 2027 whenever that happens But that's kind of what I'm seeing obviously this is on the high time frame. We scale down We are currently getting bullish price action. So that's what we want to focus on right now Yes is currently the leading index Nasdaq pushed underneath these lows. Yes is the leading index. I'm looking just to okay We had market open came down swept underneath pre-market lows same thing here on Nasdaq we broke structure to the upside Yes, haven't quite broke structured the upside just yet There's not really any significant draws on liquidity to the downside for the S&P 500 Which not that I'm struggling with that But You know it leads me to be thinking hey if we go up higher and we take out these highs You know like what else is there to target for us? Not not not that much there's no real high time for draws like the best high time from drop for the S&P 500 is these lows right here Even though we're making this bullish S&T divergence I Kind of have to keep that in mind because drop like for me draws in liquidity right now are This obvious draw in the quidity right now is to the downside versus the other draws like are all the way up here All the way up here not really super duper enticing you know Nasdaq's coming up and actually taking out all of these low resistance draws Bro Nasdaq takes out this high bro. Yeah, I'm gonna be looking for fucking shorts bro like Nasdaq We get whatever sweep down sweep back up we take out these highs like do we'll probably end up getting a bearish S&T divergence Nasdaq takes out these highs. Yes fails to take them out awesome. We can short on yes and then target this draw in the quidity That's kind of That's kind of how I feel about it. I don't know It's kind of how I feel about it Also Bitcoin dude, we're finally in this green box. I'm literally I just bought another Bitcoin So pretty I bought in with another hundred thousand dollars. I now over the past Two to three weeks I bought eight Bitcoin I bought some when we got underneath a hundred K. I bought some when we got underneath a hundred five K I just bought another one now that we're in this 95 K area You know even if we go lower bro like I'll just keep accumulating Honestly, it would be dope if we go lower. I'll buy like I'll buy fucking 20 Bitcoin down here bro The cheaper it gets the the more I want it So yeah again, I'm not a financial advisor, but I think that You know, I Think we do have one more leg up on BTC That's just kind of how I feel about it Before we get like a true true rotation all the way down, but We'll see Let's see Nazx reaching for these eyes here You You Okay, so Nazek Nazek took out these highs. Yes, it's underneath these highs Now we're kind of getting toward that toward that time that I would want to start seeing a rotation Pretty healthy retrace into this hourly gap here No Kind of yes fuck This is the right one I think it is oh yeah For a Okay, so now it's X ripping See if he has what he says You That might be going one through You You Yeah, of course Okay, yes ripping let's see if he has takes out those highs Sorry, I had to take my antibiotics, bro. I went to the ER yesterday. Isn't that fucking crazy? I went to the emergency room How insane is that like what are we doing? What are we doing You You So So we're making this bullish This bullish SMT and we've moved past these highs on ES It's kind of leaving me to want to potentially be bullish The things that I'm going to be paying attention to are really like the lower time frame the lower time frames I know that sounds obvious, but paying attention to like these five minute gaps here Do we have a gap right here? No, yeah, so like paying attention to this five minute gap here As we come and retrace down one do we inverse it to do we even come to it? Um Other things that I'll be focusing on is like I mean I never really use those but because there's no other Confluence we have this order block and this breaker block right here Okay And all of these are kind of lined up correctly I think once we close this bullish hourly candlestick we're going to get a retrace down Anyways, or we're going to get a move down anyways. It just depends on if that move down is to push us higher Which is a possibility or if that move down is to send At least the SMP 500 lower to this high time frame draw on the quiddity, which also is a possibility So Time will tell time will tell The way that price is moving though it makes me feel like Nasdaq wants these highs before we wouldn't want to go lower Yes, I don't think we'll come up and grab these eyes if Nasdaq can grab these highs. I mean it's already 950 Nasdaq's just moving up and again like this is this is what I expected kind of on the fundamental bias of the fact that Look, you know tech stocks are down a drastic amount. We just took out a super high time frame draw on the quiddity here on the four hour You know, what are what are what are investors? What are investors going to do when they see their their favorite stock in video? You know what are investors going to do when they see that in videos down Fucking 15% from the highs and like Nasdaq is trading lower on the open. They're going to want to buy that you know so it just depends on How much more how much more strength that they could put in but also like this initial move up was expected It's exactly what I was expecting Just off of the head like knowing the traders mindset of These are valuable stocks. They are down significantly from the highs There's extreme fear in the market and we just came down and we swept out a significant draw on the quiddity You know if there's extreme fear There's been a lot of selling and we hit a significant draw on the quiddity in the market What's likely going to happen? We're going to get moves up now so Yes, it's still chilling down here when Nasdaq continues to get higher and higher up It's low key feeling like Nasdaq is just going to go all the way up here and take out these highs I think yes is going to stay right stay right put It's hard to say whether or not I am Even want to take trade off of this today Because we just drag moves down drag moves up All right Nasdaq Nasdaq is gunning for these highs Literally not a single black candle or down candle insight whatsoever That's a thing though If Nasdaq doesn't grab these highs Obviously that Nasdaq wants these highs ready right If Nasdaq starts giving us a five minute retrace Then I'll just simply long up to these highs if Nasdaq gives us a five minute retrace down before Taking out these highs But this to me seems like there's just a bunch of This to me just seems like bread up here So if Nasdaq wants to start a retrace Looks like yes is slowing down and looks like Nasdaq slowing down I don't know. It's a pretty close gap right now But if we can get like a healthy five minute retrace on Nasdaq down Then yeah, I'll just be willing to long up until these highs because I don't really I don't want to short against this trend It's just like yesterday bro or just like yesterday and the day prior. It's like I took I took the opposite trade of what I should have like I got fucked up like yesterday. We had a huge sell-off Um, I traded towards the strong-jong liquidity I got stopped out the day prior when I didn't do that. I got stopped out Playing the wrong side of the field for both Training days. It is what it is But I think that this is pretty clean right here Especially if we inverse this hourly gap, you know if we can inverse this hourly gap Get a deep healthy retrace in here then boom we can target these highs See what the four hours in for Norse four hour Yeah, that's what I would want I All right, so we're going to inverse that hourly gap. Now, because the 10 AM candle is opening, I think that we can look for a pretty solid retrace here on the five minute. We're definitely not going to come into this gap, but it's literally just going to be as simple as seeing a change in order flow on the one minute. But again, that's all if we don't come up and take out these eyes. So the 10 AM candle has opened. What I would want to see would just be a simple break of one minute structure to the downside. On either of these indexes showing me that, hey, we're getting that proper five minute retrace in by changing direction on the one minute. And then all that I would be looking for would be a change in direction back to the upside on the one minute. And then go ahead and long up to go ahead and long up to these highs. Because that's the draw liquidity for the day. There's no doubt about it for NASDAQ. I mean, we got bullish SMT divergence. You know, wait. Okay, cool. Yes. Okay, nice. We're getting some down candles here. Not quite a full break yet, but slowly, but surely again, you know, if we could come down, sweep out some of these lows. Let's see. Yes, has a little five minute gap right here that I wouldn't mind. You know, I just want a strong, healthy, five minute down candle. And then just see a clean and simple one minute where we're changing order flow back to the upside via inverse for value gap breaker structure of the upside. You guys know the drill. Let's first see this break down. NASDAQ is obviously the more bullish pair. That's the trade that I'm going to want to take the trade on. There's not many confluences here. I mean, we have this five minute gap. It doesn't really matter as long as we just get that change in order flow. It's all that I care about. Damn, okay, so we don't break structure there, but we've already broken structure the downside on ES. So I would like a deeper, I would like a deeper retrace than this one that we have right here. But. Fill in this bearish gap. Nice. Yes, it's going lower. NASDAQ, let's just get a break of structure, dude. Even though it's the more bullish pair, but I would like to see a deeper retrace than what we're getting right now. I wouldn't really want to see the price turn around just yet. As long as we can close this camelsick bearish, that would be ideal. We have new lows that we have to target for the breaker structure. Yes, it's already broke. All right, let's see here. I want to make sure that NASDAQ closes that bearish candle first. Damn, bro, are we really going to inverse this gap right now? Even if we inverse it, I don't want it. Yeah. Okay, good, we didn't. Okay, we've 54 seconds left on this five minute down candle. Let's see if ES breaks structure the upside here. ES breaks structure and NASDAQ inverses this gap then we're good to go long. Just trade it up to these highs. Nice. I would like for us to go lower. Let's get healthier retrace. Nice, nice, nice, nice. Now that's a good looking five minute candle. Now we're talking. Now we're talking. Now we're talking. We're still in a good position. If NASDAQ inverses now we look great. If NASDAQ inverses this gap right here, the upside, but long up to the highs. ES breaks structure here. Let's see here. Damn, bro, are we going to do it in one single candle? I would hope not. We close all the way up here. We just got to go long. Damn, bro, this shit's going without me no, bro. Okay, well luckily I got a decent fill. I was able to get filled right here. Nevermind, it's kind of a shit fill. What does ES look like? ES looks similar. Imagine this comes and barrels my stock. It's very possible. Okay. Let's go a shot, we get that close to these highs. Right, man. Okay. This is a horrible risk for Ward, bro. And I have a lightweight feel like we want to go lower, which is kind of spooky for me. Like we might crash down and take out this low and this low, but I don't know. Maybe if we can just get the juice needed, just please, if we want to go lower, just do it after we take out those five minute highs. Just do it after we take out the hourly highs, bro. We already made it, bro, that's a huge hourly wake. There's no way that we want to go lower than that. Come on, man. Come on, man. Come on, man. Come on, man. Come on, man. Come on, man. Come on, man. Come on, man. Come on, man. Come on, my. Come on, my. My. Come on. My. No! Oh, my. Oh, my. Come on, my. Come on, my. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. I'm getting small to grow the past month, dude. Has not been good. Oh, my God. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Stopped out. Lost 70,620 K on that one. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Okay, we're getting a deeper leg down here, I guess. Probably going to manipulate these five minute lows. Maybe come into this 15 minute gap. Maybe come into this five minute gap here. I'm not done today. I'm definitely not done today, bro. Definitely not fucking done today. Definitely not done on this one, bro. I'm going to dub the fuck out of this Nasdaq trade, bro. There's no way we leave those highs. There's no way we leave those highs after inversing a one-hour gap like that, bro. There's no fucking shot that that happens. I'm dubbing this. Telling you, bro, right now would be the prime time to just punch along in. Telling you, bro, right now would be the prime time to just punch along in. Telling you, right now. Right now would be the time. Right now would be the time to clock that bitch in. Watching these gaps to get inversed. Watching this gap to get inversed. If we inverse this gap, fucking punching in longs, dude. Punching them in. Hear me. Clock that shit in. Edward. Oh my god, yeah, if we inverse this, I'm going low. Inverse it. Bitch. Inverse it. Inverse it. I freaking dare you. I'm literally full fucking porting. I'm full porting up to those highs. I'm full porting up to those highs. The second that we inverse this gap. Don't take out the highs without me, bro. Don't take out the highs without me, bro. Don't take out the highs without me, bro. Don't take out the highs without me. Are you fucking kidding me right now? Don't take out the highs without me, bro. Oh my, are you fucking kidding me, dude? I'm going low. I'm going low. I'm going low. I'm going low. I'm going low. I'm going low. I'm going low. I'm going low. I'm going low. I'm going low. I'm going low. I'm going low. I went in with way too much money. We'll figure this out though. There'll be a way for me to move my stop. I did not think that that was going to be that much. Just so you guys understand this much of drawdown. Or when we got down here, I was down $40,000. So all the way down here, this would be like a 200 something thousand dollar loss. Maybe even more. We need to find a spot to be able to move my stop loss. We need to find a spot to be able to move the stop for sure. Like 1 million percent. Yeah. Can move my stop until we get bullish. Confluence is out of one of these 1 minute. Confluence is and that's kind of an issue right now. Yeah. When we got down here, I'm currently down 110K on this. It's a lot. It's not. We got to get bullish confluence is out of this. Yeah, if we can get that, then I'm immediately moving my stop. You're fucking capping. We broached our shit down. Yes, we got to break out of this zone shit that we're in. Better. I don't want to move my stop yet because we could do like a sweep and then move higher. It's hard because it's a lot of drawdown right now. Like that's really as far as I want to let price go for real. We got to turn this shit around. If we can get a bullish candle like this, then I'm comfortable moving my stop underneath. Here if it says bearish, bearish, I don't like it as much. I would like to see maybe. Yeah, if this next candle can even just push a wick above this high, then I'm completely comfortable moving my stop underneath this candle stick weight right here. Right now. Not. Oops, dammit. Okay, I like where we're at now. Okay. Okay. I'm still in this. I have a move my stop yet. Come on. Come on. I'm just not fucking shot. We leave these highs like this. Okay. Please. Hit the highs. I'm literally exiting out of two of my positions and then letting one run with very managed stops. Yes, bro. Holy shit, dude. Oh my, okay. Really bad. Okay. Now I'm only down $21,000. I'm moving my stop loss underneath these lows. I still have extended take profits because I think that we can potentially go higher. We have this is the top of the one hour gap on ES. We can also target these highs. I think NASDAQ is going to want to come up and take out these highs. Wow, bro. Talk about. Okay. So now I'm only down $21,660 bucks today. That makes me feel a lot better. I was very, very man over leveraged on that position. That was not good, bro. And this position as a whole is not good. I looking back on this entire trading day as a whole. I shouldn't have been trading today. I was literally in the ER yesterday. I don't know what else I was thinking. This was an emotional trading day for sure. This was not something that I'm proud of. Not a proud trading day. Even though I knew where the market wanted to go, this was say, I mean, it wasn't in terms of like this entry. I mean, like, you know, I could have gotten a better one. Sure, maybe could have just entered off the one minute SMT divergence from these lows up to these lows. From these lows down to these lows. But what was I saying? But the leverage is where I fucked up, bad. Or just, yeah, the contract size, those very bad. Or at least sort of out of it now. Kind of the sticky situation that I'm in right now. So the fact that my stop loss on the rest of this position is still underneath these lows. And I don't really want to move it to break even because we very well could retrace to break even and then continue higher. I think Nasak wants these highs. And I think ES wants these hourly highs. Especially if we're planning on inversing this gap. I don't know, especially with a candle like that. I don't really see that leading to like a whole bunch of bearish moment. At least I don't think we could potentially get these highs. Just going to watch this gap, I guess. Sad thing is if I end up getting stopped out on this, then I pretty much end up at the same, if not a worse position than I was just off the first trade losing. It'll put me in a worse position. Yeah, if I lose this, then I lose, then I'll be down like 90K instead of what was it before? 60K? So I would like to be able to take some partials at these highs and move my stop to break even. That would be nice. I mean, I think we push past, if we push past these highs, we're, I think we're bound to take these highs out. I think ES wants those hourly highs. Tricky chain day. Tricky chain day. All right. Get up. Get up. Hit that page. Come on. Come on now. Nice. Come on. I'm looking like just closed my entire position. If we take up these highs. Move my stop loss underneath here, maybe. I didn't grab that hourly highs. We're so fucking close. Come on, dude. Are you fucking playing with me right now? Mike, bro. Two inches away. Dicks length away, bro. Please. Come on. Do it. Do it, bro. Please do it for me, bro. Hang it. Thank you. Okay. Nice. Feels good, man. Okay. Now we are going to move stop loss in the slight profit here. Underneath these lows. Low key, bro. I might just close everything here. It might just be smart. These are the hourly highs. Once ES takes out these hourly highs, I'll close everything on NASDAQ. Once ES takes out these hourly highs, then I'll close everything on NASDAQ. I think ES is going to take out these highs. That puts me in a profit for the day, which, again, believe it or not, only a $12,000 $378. $12,378.68. I'll close two seconds later. But if for when ES takes out these hourly highs, I mean, low key, I'm thinking about just like closing it right now, but I don't know. We'll see what gets hit first. This or the hourly highs on ES. Probably get hit at the same time, no. Once one of these gets hit, then I'll close for full-take profit. Whichever one happens first, this or ES is hourly highs. Just going to believe in like this. If this gets hit, then we'll be up 50K for the day. But, bro, it could have been a much bigger... Okay, I'm going to close everything here. Nice. Let's see. Did ES take out the hourly highs? It's about to. Bro, honestly, I made the fucking most out of what I could have today. Oh, wow. It should have been a much bigger and better day, but it is what it is. I mean, shake it out. I'll leave with fucking $64,000 on the day. Like, I'll take that any day of the week. I'll take that any day of the week. This is what we're looking like. It's actually not too hot. But this is what we're looking like on the month of November. We're down 153K because we had that big loss on Friday. Losing $174,000. And then we pretty much made it all back damn near on Monday. We made 130K. And then we lost around, I mean, okay, with fees included. Yeah, I mean, it was 20K, but wait, there's no fucking way. Maybe one of the trades didn't close when I checked, but I mean shit, bro. I guess 40K on Wednesday and then another 132K. And then we were able to make back half of this loss by making $62,000 today. So negative $174K for week one of November, or at least the trading week one of November, 21K for week two of November. We have to have a better week next week. Really, I mean, because I've been sizing up obviously. I mean, I told you guys this last time, but I'm sizing up in November. So the goal is for me to turn this around. And then ideally, you know, if we turn it around, we can end in the green like 150K or in the green, maybe 300K and kind of start consistently. I mean, we've been doing it. I mean, we've been seeing these big swings. And this has kind of been my stable throughout the past couple of months. So last month was a bad month, but the month prior obviously did really good. And then August did really good. Like if I can keep my months around here, if not a little bit higher, see like we're staying in like the pretty steady six figures a month range. But obviously there's down months that are involved with that or like break even months. Like October was a break even month. July was a break even month. But other than that, like all the other months have been green, which is pretty good. So again, it's just, you know, as long as we don't, I mean, even if we get one of these months, it's not the end of the world, but it's obviously nice for us to not have something like that. But anyways, that's that for Trade Recap for the day. I appreciate you boys. I'll see you guys on Monday.

=== VIDEO 25/34 : Live Day Trading Making $7,052 (I BROKE MY TRADING RULES)-npbvcGXKDRE.txt
============================================

Alright boys, this is how I made $7,000 day trading NASDAQ this morning. We had a no news Monday today and honestly price action was pretty yucky. I cannot lie but I made the most out of it and had to actually adjust my bias multiple times but it is what it is. I ended up making some money and yeah that's really all that matters about trading is making money and making sure your bias is correct. So let me go over my high time front bias. Oh yeah also we were talking about trade wars on stream. If you guys aren't watching me I go live every single morning on kick at 9 a.m. Eastern time pretty much doing exactly what I'm showing you guys right now live trading in front of you guys. So on the four hour time frame we are in this massive downtrend okay we have these high time frame lows underneath here. There really isn't much to go off on the four hour we have this four hour imbalance right here. The main thing that I was looking at was on the hourly time frame. So on the hourly time frame we had this hourly imbalance right here and we had previously came through swept out liquidity and then sold off and we are now playing within this internal liquidity. Same thing here on the S&P 500 okay we had had a voodoo. We're actually forming a high time frame S&T right now as well which is even more confidence for us to take out these high time frame lows. But again we have high time frame lows all the way down here on top of that. On the four hour we didn't have much we had this hourly imbalance but that ended up getting invalidated upon market open and that was part of the reason why I thought we were going to go up and take out those highs on NASDAQ because we ended up breaking hourly structure and for me I was like okay cool that means we'll probably want to go up and take out these highs here. So going into market open during London session we had a five minute S&T for this selloff during pre-market. So we had higher highs on ES and lower highs on NASDAQ. NASDAQ ended up selling off heavier than ES because that's expected ES was the lagging index and we actually form another S&T at these lows here. So we have these lows to these lows and this is happening during our manipulation time frame. Okay right before our macro opens and on ES we actually don't end up making those lows. So now NASDAQ is the lagging index. Okay we also made like there was so many S&T's we had these this S&T but then really what we want to look at is when market open. Okay so market opened we come down we make this bullish S&T and then on top of that we make another bullish S&T if we look or actually sorry no we don't my bad but we make a bullish S&T on the five minutes right here we had a one minute bullish S&T but that doesn't really matter mainly I'm looking for S&T's on the five minute. So we have this bullish S&T during our manipulation time frame on ES we can see that we ended up breaking structure of the upside on the five minute invalidating bearish order flow so from there really just looking for bullish order flow to show continuation. We get this little retrace down there wasn't really much to consider there wasn't really any fair value gap so the best that you could have done would just say hey look we have order block in a breaker both like this up candles the breaker this down candles the order block we end up pushing in there and then you would have to find a one minute entry but on NASDAQ we actually had an imbalance in here and that's what I was going off of so we ended up breaking five minute structure when the macro hit again invalidating bearish order flow we had the S&T there's a lot of things to go off of here we have these uh London session highs and on top of that we have uh we had three relative equal highs so if we take out all of this we can see boom relative equal high right here and then we can see boom relative equal high right here and then boom relative equal high right here so after seeing that somebody in the kickchat was like oh it's gonna be another bearish SMT um off this because this made a high and NASDAQ didn't take out those highs and I was like no bro we're just going this is just relative equal like relative uh equal highs because we're not going to get an SMT and then another SMT off of the same exact highs um we're not going to hit an SMT hit another SMT then hit another SMT like that's just the accordion pattern um so after seeing that after seeing the five minute breaker structure I was looking for a continuation of five minute order flow we have this imbalance right here and then boom price ends up selling off filling it perfectly and then boom we get an up candle in the one minute we were this entire time we were also maintaining one minute bullet structure my stop loss wasn't there it was underneath these lows but um we were also maintaining one minute bullet structure okay my first take profit was this high right here because I expected again relative equal highs to all get taken out and then my second take profit was all the way up here these were other London session highs that did not end up getting hit and yeah I was only able to hit take profit one and then the rest was stopped out of break even um and I'm okay with that today was a no news Monday we are literally just seeing really price really choppy price action right now we're literally just consolidating so it is what it is um it's uh it's difficult to trade on a no news Monday and I'm just happy that I was able to get out in a slight profit of $7,000 so yeah that was the main overview for today it was just longs up into the least highs it got hit literally instantly after like four minutes so that was nice and yeah uh pretty pretty simple day if you guys want to see me doing this live every single morning again watch me on kick and if you guys want to know how I use all these concepts how I put them together you guys can go ahead and apply to my trading blueprint where I do full coaching full mentoring for you guys um and there's going to be a link for the application to that down below and also a link to my kick streams down below all right so with that big said I'd love to appreciate you guys peace out

=== VIDEO 26/34 : Live Day Trading Making $7,370 (HOW TO FIND DAILY BIAS)-MzJK2-NDOhk.txt
============================================

What is good guys this is how I made it 7,370 dollars day trading the S&P 500 today. I took two trades. The first trade was a loss and then the second trade right after that was a big fat W. So we were going to explain both the thought processes of the trades. The first trade was a bit dumb. I mean obviously because I lost the second trade obviously ended up playing out in my favor. So first things first we came into the market with a huge London session sell off and on top of that. So again going into the overall bias for I guess the week is I really need this weekly gap to get filled. And I think we will probably want to go and fill it either over tonight or by tomorrow. That would be ideal but this gap on both ES and NASDAQ most definitely needs to be filled completely. And we it's a new week opening gap and I guess new day opening gap as well. And as we know those are super high time frame draws on liquidity which was the overall bias for my long position today. So with that being said we'll explain the first trade obviously the first trade was a dumb trade to have taken. So don't copy what I did on this. So with these London session lows or it was actually right here these London session lows we swept these and then we started making five in a bullet structure the upside. But then boom market opens we come back down we take out pre-market lows and we had this previous week or this previous week slash previous day low that was a high time for draw on liquidity and was actually much easier draw on liquidity to hit than to be targeting this right it just makes so much more sense for price to want to go down and get there. And I actually told that to the stream but I also again I'm every time I lose a trade bro I'm marrying bias I'm marrying my my whatever my bias and I'm not reading what the market is telling me to do I need to just you know let the market tell me exactly where it wants to fucking go. So with me marrying this weekly week new week opening gap I'm like okay bet I'm all longs we come down we sweep out pre-market lows and then we invalidate this five minute this five minute gaps so I'm like okay cool there's an inverse for value gap and now this blue line is an order block so we come down into the order block and I'm thinking like oh this is great we come into this one minute order block this five minute order block we also came into the five minute breaker a whole bunch of confluences on my end and then again I I fucked up on this I thought that we inverse this gap and I did not take enough time to sit back and look and see that this actually didn't get inverse we actually closed perfectly equal with the gap and then boom I entered off that and then get swapped out literally one single candle later so that was the first that was the first rate what I failed to see was and what I failed to even think about was the five minute SMT that was actually one of the confluences for the short here which is funny because I literally entered short on the very next candle once I realized what like I went long I got swapped out and then I realized the mistake that I made and then proceeded to make way more money than the money that I lost but again I could have made so much more money if I just let the market tell me exactly what I wanted to do if I just was a little bit more patient and that is something that has fucked me up for the past like two trading days really because the last trading day I lost like fifteen thousand dollars luckily on this trading day I was able to make money but patience and marrying my bias has definitely been something that and again like I'm a profitable trader and it's you know these are things that people that trade frequently and consistently consistency like consistently like sometimes my confidence gets the best of me but anyways after I get soft out of this I didn't realize like okay or I did realize that we were making a five minute SMT but I was I was just thinking Nasdaq is lagging and Nasdaq will end up coming up above these highs that was not the case Nasdaq came up we inverse this five minute gap which again was like part of my bias of okay yeah like Nasdaq inverse this gap we're gonna go higher but a matter of fact it was just coming into this five minute order block right here so boom we have a high right here lower high right here SMT divergence if you guys are new to this channel and you guys have no clue what I'm saying if it's just absolute gibberish to you I just released a five hour long video on how you guys can learn literally every single one of these concepts and learn how to start day trading with absolutely zero knowledge so go watch that video if you guys want to understand literally every single one of these concepts that I'm talking about anyways um the we make a five minute SMT right here we break one minute structure we fill in this one minute fair value gap and then boom I get stopped out and this is actually the confirming candle for me to end up going short funny enough I was able to get filled like in the middle of this one minute candle because I got stopped out and then I was like holy shit how could I be so dumb and then yep I price ended up going down took partial profits here took full profits at the previous week or previous day low whatever you want to call it whatever that may be to you and yeah I made a whole bunch of money on this I think I made $13,000 or something on this and then I lost I can't remember how much on this one I can see yeah I lost $5,000 on the long position and then I made 12,000 something dollars on the short position so overall I was still called this a W trading day because I was a I know it like revenge trade not really the best look but um I only lost $5,000 and I'm looking to start increasing my risk size like super super soon because as you guys know I made a shit ton of money gambling over the weekend that was awesome and it like genuinely freed up a whole bunch of capital for a guy like me to reinvest that into myself reinvest it into long term assets and I just got really freaking lucky so huge freaking shout out to my luck but it just played out of my favorite I am definitely looking to increase risk as this year continues on we're pretty much at the end or near in the end of the first quarter so first quarter I started off a little bit slow and I was just trying to get back into the swing of things because I didn't trade at all or like for the majority of quarter four quarter one getting back into the swing of things quarter two I'm going hardest fuck quarter three I'm going hardest fuck and I'm super excited to get back into making a whole bunch of money in trading because crypto is just like we're not even talking about crypto right now uh it's been an absolute fucking mess and I'm at the point now where I honestly I don't want to think about it and I don't want to talk about it and I don't even want to see it so that's my thoughts on crypto for everybody that keeps asking my thoughts are let's make money day trading to make up for our crypto losses all right so with that being said I appreciate you bros got a vlog coming out later today so stay tuned or actually we will drop the vlog first and then I'll go ahead and upload this trade recap so if you guys haven't watched the vlog, watch the vlog first and then come through watch this trade recap all right bros peace out

=== VIDEO 27/34 : Live Day Trading Making $9,108 (TRADING IS SO EASY)-yREOccH0x0E.txt
============================================

Ladies and gentlemen, this is how I made $9,000 day trading the NASDAQ this morning. Come on man! You're gonna be busted. You're gonna be sick, I'm gonna kill you. Okay, everybody lock in, everybody lock in, everybody lock in, everybody lock in. First and foremost, what the fuck? Flash crash. Okay. Trump is the worst. Blah blah blah. Don't demonetize me. Trump sucks. I love, I love. Trump sucks. If you're trans, I love it. If you're not, I hate you. BLM month, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Kamala Harris, LeBron James. Okay. That's enough for today. Let's look at what the market did. Okay. Coming into, like bro, if you guys didn't understand this, I don't know what else. I think the market literally gave you free fucking money bro. If you can't understand this, quit trading. I'm kidding. If you're new, if you're new, there's going to be a link in the description to buy the day trading blueprint where I can teach you exactly. Okay. I'm just kidding. But for real though, link in the description. No, I'm not. Okay, but deadass. This shit was literally free bands. Okay. Market opens comes up, sweeps out London session highs from there. Boom. This was a little bit tricky because we didn't break five minute structure, but it's clear and obvious that we're so far down towards these five, five minute swing lows. That five minute bullish structure can no longer be respected due to their literally being no confluence is that price could react off of underneath this. We see price literally come down and sweep out these lows. So after seeing a high time frame sweep and then price come down past these five minute lows, it's safe to assume that five minute bullish order flow has been invalidated from there. What am I looking for? A five minute retrace into what a fair value got guys. This is so simple. Literally a monkey, such as myself can do it. I did it. Like bro, like I really don't today was free as shit. We come down then what happens we fill in this five minute fair value gap then what am I looking for either a break of structure or an inverse for value gap we get a break of structure on the one minute awesome. I'm in stop loss above these one minute highs. First target is these London session lows second target is equilibrium of the four hour swing from these lows up to these highs second take profit is this one hour fair value gap all take profits ended up getting hit except I'm not a caper. I'm not going to bullshit you guys. Okay. My first take profit got hit I close 50% of my position and then the rest of mine got stopped out until it just ran down and hit the rest of my take profits. And then you guys are probably wondering, hey, why did the market go up so freaking crazy. Well, simple shit. Let me tell you little baby boy, little Timmy that is that that doesn't read the news. Okay, tariffs just got delayed. So the reason for this. There's news of tariffs getting put in from big daddy Donald freaking Trump. Okay, and he says we want to increase tariffs on every other country that's bringing shit into the United States. That could potentially hurt the US economy, but in the long run, I think it'll benefit the US economy. But in the short term, we can see that it's a direct harm to it because there's a lot of different supplies that we get from other countries and raising tariffs will cause a trade war not like TJR's trade wars, which all of you guys should watch, but as in literal country warfare. Okay, so we see this huge huge fall off because of tariffs saying that they're going to happen and then this big move up was actually due to tariffs due to the announcement that tariffs are going to be delayed. So again, immediate reaction to tariffs being said, set a media reaction to tariffs being announced huge like down immediate reaction to tariffs being delayed boom big move up and it looks like we're going to want to fill in this this weekly gap. My initial bias was bullish for the day, but again, like when I get on stream and I say my initial bias is bullish and I need price to come down and sweep out these lows and then come up and take out these London session highs. That's just what I want. If market opens and doesn't take out these London session lows and then comes up and just takes out these London session highs and then gives me a perfect short setup. What am I going to do? Not short it. Right, that would be pretty dumb. I have, I'm going to short it, especially when we're this this deep into. This deep into market open like market opens we come up we sweep out London session highs and then boom right after the macro we come and fill this five minute fair value gap like it's obvious that price wants to go to the downside. Same thing here for yes, okay, we come up we sweep out boom these relative equal highs on London from London session and then similar situation we come down we don't necessarily take out these five minute lows until much later and we don't fill in this five minute fair value gap, which is why I took the trade on NASDAQ rather than the S&P 500. But same exact same exact situation where we come down to a point where there's no other confluence that can support this five minute bullish thesis on the five minute and then from there we see retracement into literally like we retrace into pretty much nothingness and then boom price ended up going down into these London session lows. And then boom tariffs get announced that they're delayed and then price sky rockets on up. So that is how I made $9,000 day trading NASDAQ this morning it was a pretty simple if you guys want to watch me do all of this live in front of you guys every single morning I live stream it on kick at 9 a.m. Eastern time there's going to be a link in the description so you guys can follow me turn notifications on all that good shit and if you guys want to learn more about these concepts no bullshit and get mentored by me there's going to be a link in the description for that as well. For my day trading blueprint alright with that being said I love and appreciate you guys hopefully you guys cooked on today it was literally free bands peace out.

============================================

All right guys, let's get into trading today. So I haven't traded this week because Monday was bank holiday, even though a lot of you guys wanted to trade for who knows what reason you guys are stupid. And then Tuesday, we were coming off of a bank holiday, we also had Powell speaking. And we were coming off of that super volatile weekend. So I preferred to just stay out of the market, let price do what it wanted to do. Right now, I think we have a great opportunity for shorts here. We have previous day highs right here on NASDAQ. Well, on the S&P 500, we're well above previous day highs. We're filling in this big ass gap. I think there's more room for us to push to the downside here. I don't think that we're going to reclaim this. I think we're going to move down. I think we're going to make a high timeframe bearish S&T from these highs down to these highs. And I think that that is going to be the way that it goes today. Really nothing else to say other than that. And yeah, we'll see how market opens. We already have a bearish S&T divergence NASDAQ made a high or high. On the five minute right here, well, yes, is making a lower high. On the high timeframe, yes, is the lagging index. Well, NASDAQ is the leading index. I would love to see us hit another rotation. We broke weekly structure. We broke structure to the downside on the weekly timeframe on NASDAQ and on the S&P 500. I think that this can finally kickstart a much needed monthly retrace. And hopefully we can revisit this monthly gap because that is sitting underneath all of this low resistance draws on liquidity on the weekly timeframe as well as if price comes down here. We will be revisiting. Previous all time highs, I think that this level is probably the most obvious level on inequities right now. Same thing here on NASDAQ. Again, we relative equal lows. We have low resistance draws on liquidity. And then on top of that, it's in line with this monthly imbalance. On top of that, we've the order block, we've the breaker block, we've previous all time highs right here. There's just so many influences that are pointing to this price right here, whether we hit it, whether we go down right now over this next week, whether we wanna make a new higher high. Eventually, I'm going to put money on it. We are going to revisit this price range. It's too strong of a price range for us not to. And right now, we are setting up really freaking good. We made that weekly break of structure, we're making a retrace into this fair value gap. Right now, we already retrace into the gap on NASDAQ and now on the lower or on the lower by higher time frames, we are potentially making a bearish SMT. So, market just opened and we are already flooding the downside. So, let's see what marketing can give us. Let's see what the marketing can give us today. We have, or we had Empire State Manufacturing Index, that came out, we're supposed to have PPI News data. Oh, wow, yeah, they already got rid of it. We were supposed to have PPI News data on Thursday, but they got rid of it because the government's obviously going to be, continue to be shut down. Government shut down is still in place. The government shut down is still in place. Terif News is going on. Lots of high volatility things being caused from the market right now. And I'm not gonna lie, bro, looking at this, like we have so much low resistance liquidity all the way down here. This entire trend line could just be sphuckin' squad white. In my opinion, what is this, Asia session lows, and then these are previous day lows, dude. Yeah, I wouldn't mind like a clean squad wipe of that. Nice, so, we have, right now we have the high time frame bearish SMT. And previous day highs up to these ESIs, previous day highs, or sorry, previous, Lula, Monday highs down to these highs. Monday highs up to these highs. Honestly, what I would like to see would be ES maybe coming back up, taking out these five in the highs, maybe these highs, maybe these highs. And then, while NASDAQ stays underneath here, and then that will give us a five minute bearish SMT divergence, and then from there, we can look for entries to go and target all of these lows. It's looking good already. We've been hourly low right there. NASDAQ is already ripping. So, we're going to have a few more. So, we're going to have a few more. Nice, so again, the gold to be have NASDAQ stay underneath these highs. Well, yes, because obviously we're closer to these highs. Have ES, take out these highs, form that five minute SMT divergence. And then look for shorts from there. So, we're going to have a few more. Boys, I'm not going to lie, I'm fucking sick, dude. Really fucking sucks. Richie, daddy wellness. Sorry, bro, but I'm 90% sure that you got me sick when we did our stream together. Sweaty, dapp ups, sitting too close. Got cucked. I'm going to have a few more. So, we're going to have a few more. We're going to have a few more. We're going to have a few more. We're going to have a few more. We're going to have a few more. Okay, let's see where ES is after that big push up.

Now would be the time that we want our reversal. Now would be the time that we want our reversal. Now would be the time that we want our reversal. Now would be the time that we want our reversal. We'll call it Raps. But again, right now, like it's 10.03 right now. We're still kind of in that zone. And in that time range, for us to be able to, like, you know, take a good trade and then have price going the opposite direction. So the main thing is that we're still in that zone. So the main thing is that we're still in that zone. So the main thing is that we're still in that zone. So the main thing is that we're still in that zone. So the main thing is that we're still in that zone. So the main thing is that we're still in that zone. So the main thing is that we're still in that zone. So the main thing is that we're still in that zone. So the main thing is that we're still in that zone. So the main thing is that we're still in that zone. So the main thing is that we're still in that zone. So the main thing is that we're still in that zone. So the main thing that we're monitoring is these eyes. So the main thing that we're monitoring is these eyes. So the main thing that we're monitoring is these eyes. So the main thing that we're monitoring is these eyes. There's just no freaking way that we take that shit out, bro. I mean, I guess so. Maybe. Wow. We took out that eye. So that is pretty much going to seal the deal for me today. Be done. I got fucking smoked today on that one loss, by the way. I lost 152K. I didn't even want to talk about the fucking loss that I took because I was assuming that I was going to be able to get another entry to be able to maybe make that loss a little bit less as bad than what I thought it was. This is just a big stop loss. And I entered with two times my original size, which makes sense, also the stop loss was two times my original size. So I ended up being like 4x, what I usually end up risking, which blows pretty fucking bad. I mean, yeah, we did have a bullish SMT from these lows right here. I just really didn't see in any world that we would want to push up today. So that was a bullish SMT. I mean, yeah, even if I was bullish for today, I wouldn't have been able to find an entry. So as much as it sucks that I lost that much today, as much as it sucks that I lost that much today, and I'm now negative on the month, which fucking blows. Is it updated? Here we go. It's half one. So I'm down, well, it says 14K on the month, but yeah, this one squad wiped. It's one loss squad wiped. This entire week, which sucks, but it's okay, because the volatility is in our favor. And we're going to be able to make that shit back. Trust me, we have been in these positions before folks. Not something that I'm tripping about. And overall, I look at the month and I'm like, okay, cool, I'm break even on the month. I could turn this the second that I have another winning day and boom, I'm back up on the month. Second that I have another winning day, we're up a good amount on the month. Second that I crushed. Next week of this month, boom, we're up as fuck. So not tripping about that. But anyways, yeah, price is just ripping up today. It's not what I expected. It is what it is. Appreciate your voice. I'll catch you guys. Wait. I think I got him. Oh, I did. He's still flying around a bit though. Bow. We got him. We got him. That's a good way to end the day. Killing a fly. I ended up losing 152K. It is what it is. Appreciate your voice. Catch y'all. Peace.

=== VIDEO 29/34 : Live_Day_Trading_Losing_234_060_WORST_TRADING_DAY_EVER-[5Peet8LZkUI].txt
============================================

Alright guys, market just opened. I did not trade yesterday. I literally just slept all yesterday. I've been like so freaking... I don't know, I'm not sick anymore. I'm just like out of it. I don't know how to explain it. But yesterday it looked like there was pretty good long setup. So, did... Mace out on good opportunity there, which kind of sucks. But it is what it is. It seems like we have some pretty good opportunity as well. I don't think we have any news today. We do have potential CPI news day on Friday. As long as the government shutdown isn't still happening. But anyways, today looks pretty good because we're forming this bullish SMT divergence. Nasdaq swept out these Asia session lows. These are previous day lows. While ES is still above them. These are previous day lows. Nasdaq again came down, swept out, Asia session lows. And then we have London session lows, Asia session lows, previous day. Or sorry, London session highs, Asia session highs, previous day highs. All stacked up, low resistance, draws on liquidity to the upside. I would like to be bullish today. One, we have this bullish SMT divergence. Two, we have three previous session highs. All stacked up together forming a strong confluence and strong draws. Strong draws on liquidity to the upside. Something that I would like to see happen would be Nasdaq to take out previous all-time highs. And then I'm not going to lie. I would like to see a bit of a rotation to the downside. Right now we are making a high time frame bearish SMT divergence on the four-hour time frame. We have a high, then a higher, higher right here, then a higher, then a lower, higher right here. So we could just start the reversal now. But in my opinion, I would prefer if Nasdaq could come up and give us a super duper high time frame SMT divergence where Nasdaq comes up above these previous all-time highs because the SMP 500 isn't as close to these previous all-time highs as Nasdaq is. We'll have Nasdaq come up, sweep out these highs, and then rotate down, have ES, say underneath these highs, and then continue down. So right now though, we are selling off pretty hard. We can actually just move these lows to these London lows right here because we already know that these Asia lows were already swept out. And yeah, we'll see what price wants to give us. There we go. Okay, so Nasdaq just came down, took out London lows, took out previous day lows. ES is still above these lows. As long as ES doesn't come underneath previous day lows right here, then we can form a bullish SMT divergence and look for rotations to the upside. We have a lot of strong draws on the quiddity to the upside. It's just a lot of low resistance draws. Like this, so low resistance draw, low resistance draw, low resistance draw, low resistance high, is a recession high, previous day high. All of these highs that are stacked up on top of each other. So, we're going to have a look at the lows that are going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to

Let's not do this right now. Let's not do this right now, bro. Let's not do this right now. Any fucking lower and I'm done. Oh my god. Please turn around. Please, bro. Yeah. Yeah. Yo. Please turn around from here, bro. Please. This is still a SMT divergence who we haven't taken out these lows yet. Again, gotta stay above these lows. Oh my god. Dog. Oh my god. Today was bad, bro. I lost. Bro. I'm fucking sick. I lost $234,000 and $234,000 and $60. Here's today, bro. Wow. Big negative on this month, bro. You're fucking kidding. Multiple bullish SMTs, every single draw on liquidity to the upside and we get smoked like that, dude. Well, that puts us at negative $185,000 on the month. Oh my god. Man. Down bad, bro. I can't believe that. I can't believe that. Man. I don't know if we get smoked like that, dude. Yeah. Gotta call it a day here. That fucking sucks. But, um. Hey, man. Full transparency, at least. Let's get a wrap it up for me today, bro. That was a rough one.

=== VIDEO 30/34 : Teaching My Friend How To Trade Memecoins-IayPad7wjfg.txt
============================================

Oh, you want to get back in? We want to get back in. We should get back in. You're a crash out. 5 souls, 5 souls, 5 souls. Oh, oh! Oh! Oh my god, I'm crashing now. I'm crashing now. I'm so fucked. Hold the line, hold the line. Hold the line! Hold the line! Get up, get up, get up, get up! Oh! Get fucking run! Get fucking run! Get run! Hell yeah! Hell yeah! Yeah! We'll do 10 soul and then both of us will place a 20 soul. So dumb. Alright guys, we are officially in the trenches. And this is going to be a little bit better than some of my other meme coin videos. Because now, instead of trading on photon, we're going to be using an actual trading bot. We're advancing. Orangey keeps putting us on the more and more game that, apparently, with Nova, you get filled. Like, fucking instantly. And also, with Nova, you can sell way quicker. Like, we're going to be using y'all as exit liquidity, essentially. But, Carson, are you familiar with any of this shit? Just, like, you've seen this before. This setup before, yeah? More of a phantom all the guy. And I have, I die with a little bit in the coins at one point. Popped into Goon or a little bit. And I was there for Ditty and Ditty party and Ditty's baby oil. But, I haven't really, like, heard much going on about the meme coins. And I'm looking right now and looking like there's a bunch of bull shit on there. But, hopefully with good faith and with Orangey's fucking wizard butt. And, at least make a couple so here. So I can get you this fucking roly that you keep asking about. Right. So, we're using a couple tools. We're using Nova and then we're also trading on photon meme scope. So, as you guys can see, most of your guys' photon wallets isn't going to have these fucking sniper knocker tools that we have on here. So, you can see that I can literally snipe this bitch the second that it migrates over. Yeah, and fucking cups he already got in with 12 soul on that bitch. So, we might want to consider figuring something out with this one or a meter network. I'll do fucking seven soul into that bitch. Okay. But, anyways, this is pretty much the trenches. Honestly, I don't even want to try and explain this shit to you. Let's just try and, like, let's just try and make some shit shakes. So, the first thing that I want you to understand is, let me pull up this Nova extension really quick. We have our quick buy amount in Salana. Unfortunately, the people can't see, but our quick buy amount is one soul right now. Even though it says on photon that it's 0.01, we'll switch it to 1 for now. Whatever you do, don't hit this one because then it'll transact with my actual photon wallet. We want the super speed Nova tracker Nova Nova bot Nova Nova Nova UAV. Pretty much. Nova aim bot essentially. So, we're going to be hitting this one. And this is pretty much where we're going to be posted up for the majority of the time. I'll give you like a brief little overview of some shit that we're not trying to look at. So, how have you seen that little ball dude that's been popping up all over the time? Hi, Fenex this dude. Yeah, I'm not a fan. Yeah, so when you see repeat memes, you don't want to buy those ones. So, like, if you see the same picture of a dude like over and over and over again, it's obviously, yeah, it's fucking plate. It's played the fuck out. So, you don't want that shit. And really like, go with whatever's speaking to you, but also we got to use our brains a little bit. So, like, think in just the meme coin narrative. So, like, some ones that I cooked back when I was doing this shit. Okay, so like this already could be potential. Potential and quit. Okay, so we were able to get in this bitch. I don't even know how much we have in it. I need to pull up the Nova shit on Telegram. Oh wait, did we already sell it? Oh cool, we made money on it. How much? I didn't even mean to sell. We made 0.2 sold. Fucking ball, I was. That's not- That fucking- that sucks that they can't see us making bread though. We can do like a- it sucks though, because like on this it doesn't even show where you bought, you know. We can just send screenshots. We can send them like how we transaction that we do and have them pop them up accordingly. Okay, bet. Sorry dude. Yeah, wait, that kind of sucks, because like, let me go back to... Tram, what's Tram? We should buy that bitch. Okay. Oh no, this was us. We made 0 dollars on this. Five. Yeah, I wish we could- I wish we were able to see like our entry and shit, because that matters a lot. I guess we gotta trust the processor some shit. Anyways, back to the track. So all of this shit that's coming in are pretty much brand new meme coins that are being made. So the one that we bought and sold like we pretty much made a total of zero- zero dollars on it. We bought and then we sold and we only made like 0.2 sold. So nothing too special, but what we're going to want to do is like find whatever's fucking calling your name. And you want to think- the reason why I clicked on that was because we saw that that one dude Cubsie he bought that block open source shit over here. And then the first meme coin that I saw was like block open source founder. So like see how that's in the same narrative of like, okay, this coin it just was able to migrate over radium. There's clearly a lot of like backing behind it and then boom now like the founder came out with- or obviously didn't come out with a meme coin, but the founder has a meme coin now. So like maybe we try and scout that super quick. That's really what you're trying to look for for like narrative type of plays. Like Real Madrid fans, nobody's going to want to buy that. You want to be thinking in the eyes of somebody that is like thinking of like real-time news. Like that's those are going to be the best plays that are going to make you the most amount of money. So like if we can look at- so like deep seek. Did you hear about the deep seek AI shit? Yeah. So there's been like a fucking quadrillion coins of this deep seek shit coming out. And like this is- this is nothing new. So like again, if there's a deep seek coin, you don't want to play into that because there's already been so many. And you can't really guess which one's going to be correct in which one's going to be incorrect. Let's try and find like another good example of like this is funny. This is like a funny anus ape now understands soon. Yeah, exactly. But the only problem is the market cap is that seven fuck me, 71,000. So like the goal is to buy coins like that now it's at 93,000. It should have allowed that bitch. So that literally would have been like close to a two X already. So we want to be able to buy those type of coins at like literally seven or eight K market cap. And then ride them until they're about to migrate. But the goal should low key be like get out before they migrate because most of the time by the time they migrate over, you're going to want to get the fuck out of that. But luckily we have the Nova bot that will be able to snipe us not only into coins that are migrating over. If we think they're going to do well like in the long term, but we're not focused on the long term, but also be able to snipe us out if we get caught up in like a migration over. Cool. Yeah, it's fucking hard. Okay, cool. So wanted me to show you like one example first and then like you can go from there. Yeah, well first tell me a little bit about what's about to graduate, what's graduated, and then what's like floor market cap that we should be looking for if we're just getting in and out. Bro, all these are new coins that are getting made literally and within the second. These are all the new coins that are being made like as we are speaking. So these are all they all start at $6.5,000 market cap. And then about to graduate means they're about to migrate over to radium. So that means like open for the public to trade and you know like regular people because you said before you were only trading on Phantom Wallet. So this once it migrate once it's done migrating, then it'll move over to graduated. So boom, it just finished migrating. Now it's graduated. And now this will be available on Phantom Wallet for you to buy if you want at a market cap of 90,000. Or now to 83,000. So the about to graduate means like, okay, it's about to migrate over newly created are literally the ones that have just been created right now as we speak. A lot of the meme coin guys like they're nasty at this and they pull up in order to fact check shit. So like, let's so Steve this dude who the fuck is he like they'll look at the Twitter they'll see like, okay, did this dude do something whatever like try and figure out like is this news legit? Or not because some people will come out like my best meme coin play ever was like a 20x on one of these it was fucking crazy. I only put like two soul in but it was lit. It was like the name was first first robot with human organs and I bought it because I was like that just sounds like fresh news. And then I clicked on the website and it was literally posted like five hours ago and somebody made a meme coin about it and then boom it went crazy. So we also we don't want to be buying like first whatever without like I mean we can because this is just a little game but ideally we're trying to make you some money here. Sometimes it'll say like first fucking horse to win a race and it's that shit was from like 30 year or like whatever like fucking years ago. So nobody cares about that. Like the biggest thing that you would want to be thinking about is like this one bro or or bit AI deep seek gen 2.1 model that bitch is already that bro that bitch is already at $15,000 market cap. So if we bought right when that came out like I can almost promise you that this shit has some sort of news behind it like if we go to the website or if we go to the Twitter or whatever it would come up with something. So that's kind of what we're trying to think about cool cool. That all makes sense. You should fucking you should get in one. Okay. You can get out of one just like in peak game and then we can swap seats and let me fucking get work. Oh, got cool. This part of it kind of sucks or at least for Eric because it's like dead silent and we kind of just have to lock in for a bit. Yeah, so there's like a lot of goose shit coming out. I don't know. I don't know why like I think there was like some some goose coin that like some something but something within crypto about a goose goose dev like all this shit is just like goose shit. I see. World's number new AI whale. I see that you have four filters on what what are you filtering for? It's not much. It's literally just pump on moonshot and then I have the age by minutes by in three. Yeah, Mark Cuban's been saying that he's gonna launch a coin but I doubt it. Crazy how fat Mark Cuban's that fucking 64K. Damn, what the fuck? Holy shit. That shit happens quick. Yeah, yeah. And if you get in the the shit at the right time. Damn, so this should just migrate it over. Let's see. Let me try and get in some shane. Yeah, so let's go. Where is it at? 113. Yeah, see that's what I'm saying. But the problem is like you don't really you really don't know bro. You really don't know. It's hard unless like you're super nasty at this and like if you're on this 24 seven it's just like trading where you start to see trends and like if you're able to Get on the trends and cook then it's wraps. Let me try and see. See my problem is I see some shit like that jow cat and when the picture was hard enough it's something that like. Yeah, like you remember that fucking coin Evan that were like they were even brat bro like that shit's cute. I would buy that shit like I don't really know. Okay, so there's a nut there's already a coin. I'm not holy shit. Wow, we might have missed the fucking play of the century. Dev sold, Dev sold. Wait, I gotta switch this over. So explain that to me a little bit too. What like what does the dev selling? I mean obviously I'm sure like what's a typical percentage of supply for a dev to hold and then like what is there any good that comes from the dev selling or? I mean maybe like long term long term. Yeah, there's good that comes from that because if it's like a genuinely good project and the dev sells then that's good. Dev sells and that means like the majority of. Yeah, it's for the it's like in the people's control now. Okay, let me lock in and try and see if there's like anything that can come our way. We're gonna hit something strong. I'm so sure of it. I feel like I'm on the fucking blackjack table right now. I love that shit. Yeah, what's this good shit going so far? Wow, he's in. Forget about it. Okay, so we're up right now. Dev just sold. We're up higher. Higher, higher. Higher. Fuck. Shoulder. Lock in. Might have to get out. Okay, okay. Okay. 9,000 dollar market cap. This is good. Should we let it cook? Let it. Okay. What did you get? I'm going to point five. Not one. Fuck. We're pretty much at entry. I'm. Workout. I'm still seeing Dixie's candles about the problem. You think so? See, that's the problem like after this amount of time. If it's not like dick or dick already. Yeah, so like we got to see where it's at. It's not even on here. We got to go back to our holdings where the fuck did that shit go? Oh, shit. Wait, what the fuck? Oh, it's not even on here. We got to bring it up on here. God damn it. God damn it. God damn it. God damn it. It's over. No! Oh! Okay, okay, okay, lock in, lock in, lock in. I thought that the shit was gone. He like off the screen. It was for a little bit. Okay, maybe we get out. You got to get out of this image brother. Okay, let's see what we made. Oh, damn, that's it. Wait, we only made... We made... Wait, there's no way. We only made 0.1 soul on that. I mean, yeah, oh wait, damn, where are they? Well, I mean, yeah, I guess that makes sense. We made, because we got in like right here. Okay, yeah, 10%. That's a 10% game. Oh, okay, it's like... Baby food, okay, okay, okay. You want to do this next one? Yeah, pop me in the game. Okay, lock in. That shit was scary, because I didn't even realize that it's not going to... Oh yeah, another thing that I forgot to tell you. If you hold your shit on here, see how it says paused. So it won't load like new shit in there. Oh, cool. So if you go off like this, then it'll be loading. So you kind of just got to like cover and then spot the shit. Okay, you tell me if you see something that looks good. Yeah, I know. Don't buy that shit. See, so like even right now, like you always want to have your mouse like off the shit, just so like it can let the shit go. Okay, something critical comes through. Yeah. So we're off the deep seat, right? Yeah, I would say off of that. And I really want to be off the game. It's like smithers to her. Unless so like that one that I bought that was like that was like creative, you know, it was like it's spelled out goose, but it was like gain overcome. Out with what a yes that is. Oh my god, they're allowed to do that shit. They've been doing a lot. They used to do a lot worse shit than that. Like that banana goose one would have been good. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's old news too. He said like a while ago that he was going to make a meme coin and people are kind of like fragrance. You better not be. No, fragrance is washed. Condoms for Gaza, that's like kind of fire. Not that one because there's already been one that's graduated. So like if you're seeing one that's already about to graduate, like all the ones after that are just trying to scam you into getting into the shit. Sometimes crazy people are that on this. Yeah, see I like I know enough to like I'm like break even pretty much every single time that I do this shit. I end up break even. It really wouldn't take much for me to get I think pretty nasty at this. I'm already good at other shit though. That's the thing. So I'm just going to keep doing what I'm good at. Oh fuck, I'm getting a phone call. Do you want to hold this shit down? That's not motherfuckers. The only thing that's a little bit spooky right now, like I'm comfortable on this bitch. Don't get me wrong, but I don't know how to sell the shit. So I do want to fucking pop a quick soul in one of these coins before jikens back because I know it would be meme. But if I hit like a fucking five X and I don't know how to get out of that bitch, I'm going to be sick. I already know I'm not going to know how to get out to, but I'm going to do it anyways for the fuck of culture. Let me see something. Come on. It's fucking hilarious. Gaping. Shale? Oh shit. Now what? Now where the fuck is it at? Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Oh my god, I'm crashing now. I'm crashing now. I'm so fucked. I literally just pissed us all the way. I'm so over for me. Literally no fucking clue where that shit went. Did you blow through all our red yet? I fucking... You don't know. Where is that bitch at, bro? Why you bro? Let me see. Let me see. I caught some shit. Eric thought I did at least. Okay. Nah. You didn't. What did you click on? Don't remember. It was funny, though. Yeah? I should have whatever. I definitely ain't no match. You ain't no match. You ain't no match. You ain't no match. You ain't no match. You ain't no match. You ain't no match. I should have what I've ripped. I should have what I've ripped. You ain't no match. On God, shale erect. How about that for Goosie? Yeah, nah. Yeah, nah. Yeah, nah, there's no open positions. I can make a plane, man. Wait, so we already lost 0.5 soul, though. No, no, no, that. Oh fuck, bro. Maybe you did. Oh my god. Yeah. You bought it on the shit that I told you not. I knew it, bro. I fucking my yeah if we broke you plot ticked you didn't know oh I thought that was Fuck no, you bought right you literally bought at the worst possible time like the Ever there's not even weeks up that shit was free bro. How do I even get fucking filled up there? All right, remember I told I told you we're not clicking on this we're clicking on this oh Shit Okay, so I just pissed away at actual soul that's fire Right right right of course, you know you pause the shit again You gotta let it it's like fucking quick firing like you gotta let the shit run and like the savvy patty broke Oh No, see that's the thing like that's Should that 64-hate market cap. No, so there's like there's shit that like They'll so like let's say Fucking a project wants to I don't know like Super jugg people they'll Get their shit up on pung fun. They'll have all these snipers like buy it up so it so it can just like immediately graduate You go what I'm saying my brain code. Yeah, did the food come No, but it was my weird. I bet you said we can't do this He's a get off of memes yeah get cars and out of the Want on the bulldog. I'm sorry. I can't ever really look okay Go not not on holdings. Okay, so Once you cop the shit we're gonna have to go to okay, oh my god Okay, so we probably got filled like up here, okay, so we're up right now So if we want to sell we just click this hundred percent shit No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, I mean there's there's only four holders of this shit And like if I'm being badass, I don't know remember you told me that Animal shit was said Want on the bulldog or you fucking don't he sell you just click the hundred percent to sell a hundred percent of it It's seen no no vain by we got Yeah, we're literally one of the four holders and the dead hasn't even sold you Okay, so boom we pretty we made no money somebody came in that bitch That wasn't us oh really yes, we put one soul into that so far and we're up No, we broke even yeah, you sure yet Now we made point zero to Yeah, but we also lost it So go scroll back up and then click memes go This is fucking awesome we got up the lot size pretty Yeah, can we start fading to solar after I make money not after these First couple plays that I've seen you hit we got it we got an arrow it down a little bit Like want on the bulldog like that's not something that we want to be going I mean come on dude Like think in think like Use use the memes that are already coming out and use the shit that is graduated and that's about to graduate Like to your advantage you see what I'm saying so like the goose shit was super easy for me to see like Okay, yeah, I know that I know I know that this goose shit is fucking popping right now I know that Mark Cuban deep C.A.I. is like popping right now So if there's like spin-offs and shit like that like derivatives of certain narratives like those are little ones That we can pick up on and then in the off chance that we do catch the bottom of like a crazy new news thing then that's like That We like those will be our runner runners, but like the quick flips will be the ones that are like derivatives of Current plays that are already going on Can't believe people said on this bitching That's actually this is probably this is probably worse brainrock then young answer young answer get on that You know young answer young answer fuck not too late not wrong one Oh, bro God damn it. Okay fuck Get us out of there dude. This is some fucking bullshit So answer just posted. He's like a huge crypt on Twitter guy. He um Yeah, the dead fucking sold that I know yeah, I know what is he get from that? He does the the dad probably makes like a couple bucks or something boogie wait what the fuck? I'm not even live right now we should buy this That's a key I bet they're gonna hear I bet they're gonna air drop it to one of my wallets There's six wait how do I even have did you ever post this because I know I I know I Post it yesterday I'm sorry Oh, okay, so handsome that's like that's like a that's like crypto Twitter shit So like I can almost answer him is like like one of the top people on crypto Twitter and I'm assuming like all of those coins came out because he posted a picture of himself. I was like Like a younger version of himself the second that you see shit like I don't know It's hard to explain, but when like shit like that comes out like you can get in and get the fuck out And like make easy easy bread on something like that. Okay, so again this was this is another good example for you so strategic Dakota reserve strategic South Dakota reserve I can almost I can I'll probably bet money that there was something that just came out Because we could see in both these images. It's been an SBR like I can guarantee you that some shit came out about South Dakota Doing something with some sort of reserve Okay Okay, I'm feeling you I give like do like one more test run at this shit and then we're gonna have to start going in a little bit deeper Now all of that shit's that like condoms or gods that we know I know there's one that's up I just saw so many other bitches fucking pop up Dude Pete so Orange in his demons sit like this all very long and just wait for with like six more monitors than us They have the potion wallet they have this they have Like multiple monitors up there with telegram like groups and in bots and in the discord like tweet alerts like bro I feel like a retort or any like just looking at for this. It's damaging to the mental for sure But again think about it before those guys Those guys were just traded those those guys were playing Fortnite You know, so it's like either play Fortnite or or brain rot in different way make literally like fucking Just gangster I know he's so hard you want to hear some dope shit that he did yesterday Apparently there was like some coin that it was like Fortnite coin or something Okay, no, no, so go and click on it click on it click click Okay So we got destroyed easy easy easy easy hold hold hold How many hold right? I'll see the holder six in at the bottom of the page right there Holders doesn't really matter. We want to see like transactions coming. There's a lot of holders hold hold hold hold hold Hold let's just see where this bitch goes until we can up the lot size So 29 holders Fox sniper sold I mean, I think we're gonna get out of it. What is sniper sold mean it just means that somebody like Like somebody that that's night the coin like I don't necessarily know what photon like labels the shit as but When it says sniper sold it just means somebody that's not the coin prior with like hella bread just sold so Yeah, let me see what are Okay, so we're right we're not down bad like at all. We're still sitting at 99.32 So we've lost some money, but now it's time to start increasing our lot size here So what we're going to do is we're gonna pull up this extension and we're gonna set this bitch to five soul now Now we're gonna now we're gonna be able to move like the market a little bit We're not gonna we're gonna make sure we don't do 50 yeah, not sure. Okay, so much as 50's all 50 times two 50 Couldn't even 20 for okay No 100 100 sold it's like 12.5 J 12.5 J Dude good freaking job man, it's gonna be nice. Okay, so Not we up we up our shit to five soul now. That's what our quick buy is said at I need you That and I just need you to be a little bit faster with the shit You're a little you're a little bit too slow right now so like right now You're clicking on shit down here by the time it's down here. I don't know if you should about it Okay, like we're we got a look for shit. That's popping up like a That's why you get so pissed when I freeze it because you're talking about I need to catch like top three Yeah, yeah, and then another thing so like give me the shit back so You enter into a shit enter into something and like let's say I click buy on this I don't want to click buy and then free I know I know the shit go on that no click buy and then click this so we can see the chart immediately and get a good understanding of where we got in at so That this is the big leagues now. We're dealing with five soul. This is a pretty much 1.1.2 fucking racks down on I'm gonna let you call the first buy and I'm gonna do it fast and diligent Then once we make for that's the thing. I don't want to call it up because there's gonna be multiple of like you know And that's the thing when there's multiple you have to choose like give me this should bet so When there's multiple and you can tell that there's like a super strong narrative like the answer one There was only a couple coins that were made but there was one That was made that like literally just said like Why a as the shit you don't want to buy that you want to buy the one that says like Answer him and then the under things that young answer him and it was like a full 4k picture of him You know like you want the one that looks the best the one the title that is like cleanest and all that and as long as There isn't like another one that's already graduated or ready about to graduate then you're chilling so like But let me try and show you an example of that be like Yeah, so like all of these fucking the condom ones. It's like obvious. Those are those are bad Yeah, I think I think you get the gist of the shit. I think you take over again We got five soul on the line now. This is a this is a band a band we're playing oh They're going crazy with this cow shit. Who is this bro? I just saw seven coins of that Sometimes they'll flood sometimes they'll flood memes go with the with like Cal or whatever to like try and build hype for They're like actual drop or something or though or like the main Twitter will be like oh Cal is dropping a meme coin in like this day like I guarantee you that actor is probably gonna come out with like or post in some shit about like I'm coming out with a meme coin and all those people we're trying to take advantage of it Yeah, like Cal is he's clearly like he clearly posted something on Twitter talking about I'm making a meme coin So when we see shit like that we want to avoid it because it's just impossible to guess which ones the right one or if there even is the right one He had to have posted on Twitter about something. Let me see what Twitter's talking about oh My god Boogie come here lay down trying to play this shit Oh Yeah, sometimes you don't see shit. Yeah, it's really like I'd be really hard to fire where to actually sit in the trenches to stay disciplined cuz I want it Wait, don't sell don't sell yet. So it's night per soul dev soul were fucked hit. Yeah, get out At really really yeah, we'd call to pop out of that bitch. I should we gotta be quicker bro.

There's hello holders coming through. No, this is crazy. This is crazy. Okay, okay So Wait, I got to move this so I can see it's I believe it starts to migrate when it hits like 90k Market cap so if we get anywhere close to that we don't want to get fucked Damn, we got to see some people pull through right now pull through pull through Holders increasing 85 good Good I'm still bullish Wow, you would have spanked I would have thanked them see that's the problem bro. The shit is so unpredictable We're sitting at like probably only like point something sold down right now holders are diminishing by the second This line hold the line Yeah, it is really hard to play these ones because then you get married to the bag and you just know some Newshits probably dropping right now that's like literally a 100x holders diminishing Gee, oh my rug pull Oh Well, it was the damage on that damn okay, so we lost like 2.2.

Did you even okay? Yeah, you did buy it Did you Oh wait, no, no, no, no, no, no no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we didn't even do you How do we make it so it doesn't? Fuck it did fill you know Let me see what the damage was oh wait no, no, okay, no, no, no, no, I mean like kind of sorta I don't know what the damage of this was but yeah What what was that? I don't know, bro. It just looked in a eye. Okay. Oh my god. We just gave it a death just full exit liquid to be okay okay. CTO dead got out. Let's see four holders. Let's see if this bitch can go. Come on. Come on. Cause our entry is literally the top of that candle bro. Come on bro. Damn. Now you see what's going on here. There's no no positions. Let me see. Is it because we're buying with 20 soul and it's literally not even letting us get in that bitch? No, no, no. There's no way. We should. Oh, maybe switch back the 10 soul. Maybe maybe 15. Yeah, we can try the. Yeah, yeah. Let's get in with 15. Oh my god. I just fucking sold the bag again on covert. I keep I broke course. Of course that's a good look. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Don't don't cry over spilled milk. You got this. Of course, covert was a great look. It's not for who don't do much. You're always going to be this. It's not over tension. It should. No, should have. Just check you out. Mark Lambo. Fuck. You're in. I followed that. You're in. No, no, no. This might actually play out in your favorite. No, that had to be from our buy. That had to be from our buy. It's definitely from our bro. That's definitely from our buy. We're in that bitch. No, no way, bro. Yeah, we're in it. Fuck, there's only 10 holders. They got to start moving. I don't know about this one. Mark Lambo. I don't know about this one. Neither do I. That's scary. Dev. We entered at 24,000 or 24k market cap. Dev hasn't sold yet. You think I should get out. We're up right now. Like 10%. Hold the fucking line. I'm very finicky. Me too. There's 11 holders. I think we got to get out. That's actually why I've never thought. Nobody's entertained. Nobody's entertaining. Crash coin. Let's see. Huh? Wait. Okay. We brought. We made it. We made it. How long? So are you fucking kidding? Hellabred from you. You just made 10 soul from that. There's no way. Positions back to menu. While it's wait. I'm awesome. Did you put 20 soul in? No, no, no, I put in 15. Oh, we're still just running back from the bullshit. And I guess. Oh, yeah. That's definitely what it is. But yeah, I made like. What did I make on that? Come on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. There's no way. Did I not. Was I not able to get out of that? Okay. No, I wasn't. And I'm confused. Is it not like updating or something? No, we just we got world. No, no, no, we're chill. That was a good buy. Kind of. I mean, yeah, I made five soul. It's not bad. But on 15. So that's only like 30%. That's actually not too bad. Low key with the Nova shift. If you come in heavy, like people will just wait. Like from phomo. Oh fuck what am I fuck what I fuck what I fuck what yeah, yeah fuck what I'm Okay, yeah hold the line Nine holders. Let's see if it gives it goes higher 25 no Yeah, I played a simple shit some time Gotta play the whole shit sometimes good fucking by No way there's no way that knob, bro. We had to get themed on slippage on here. There's just no way For many positions we don't have any go to wallets Yeah, see we're getting Great. Oh, yeah, I see what's happening now great. Yeah, so we the folks that can't see this shit We're entering with like 15 soul and because we're entering with 15 soul it causes the market to just go berserk But then when we exit we're obviously the largest holders so we're getting Okay, so this makes sense what we need to do is we need to start micro clipping But you gotta go back to 10 soul to I'm telling you that's the number 10 soul is bitch bag Shit, but really didn't really bro. We're like two good calls in our own right there though. Honestly No, cuz we're down That's just cuz we were fucking we were the ones that caused the chart to move up 31 black looks strong Where where it's cooked and all Fuck yeah get in that bitch twin fuck. Oh, okay. That was us. That was us. We go any higher Yes, oh dude fuck yeah Average by was 10k market cap We're 15k fuck there's only five holders We're gonna get fucked on the slippage how the fuck are we getting? He's like this bro My god Do something one other five people saw that bitch makes like the smallest lip on the chart Peace mark coin is going down right now Absolute god damn it bro. Can people buy this bitch for the one time Wait, no, we lost we lost three soul all right This is but this is last play has to be last play we got to go out with the bang bro Fuck okay Okay Okay Seven eight holders ten holders. Yeah 17 holders People are going in with like baby food though. See that's the thing were the ones that like move the move the market 17 holders is good bump. Oh I don't know what this toad play is though. It's something to think about Seven they're holding strong Dev might get impatient though that is literally has this thing growing a trigger just like us Yeah, we're literally face off right now in the wild west whoever pulls that bitch first is coming out with some bread Just in case Damn bro, we gave him just enough to sell on us For guys that were holding to they were so that's Like let's let's go to the wrong way. Oh Yeah, cuz of the slippage. I'm always thinking that I'm like all into something when I see the Yeah, we lost we're down 30 soul right now We didn't we should be fucking know we shouldn't be fuck we shouldn't throw the towel and yeah, you got a fucking oh Good fucking catch brother Hey This is gonna be one of those ones I could send one of those AI ones gotta be one of the AI ones come on cup see by this bitch Fuck you bro. Oh my god God fucking damn it dude That was a bad one Fuck yeah get in there brother God had made something move nowadays Okay, that's us that's us God fucking damn it Let me see the wallet Oh, my damn it dude, which has happened Oh My god, okay, yeah, so we're down like 50 soul now Try and do something makes like we got to panic we're panicking now. We got a not to not that Get something quick something easy something that you just know is gonna rip Just right off the top of the head Like simple those fucking those agent. Oh my god simple shit like that, you know Those agents there's the bro where the only holder left who is this jackass It's a dead bro. We're just giving you gotta get out of that Fuck man One more Ron bro try and try and get this shit back for us You can't give these guys so much leverage maybe holding us hostage while we're in tensile theme Here we go, okay, okay, yeah, yeah Mine holders 11 holders 12 13 fuck yeah fuck yeah, yeah Keep it keep it keep holding keep holding we need something big we need something big yes dev soul fuck them Fuck them fuck em. Oh Ron. Please please please please please please please please please please No No, no, no we gotta make a break 36 holders 36 holders 41 holders and I wish I could take over cups He's walleted by the shit for us all of this night was did you just go in with another soul? Yeah, just a fucking show him was happening This shit's gonna fucking rip People already lost hope Mid 5.8. Did you so yeah? Oh? She's Check the wallet no see if we walk the way I mean I don't know it's gonna be hard even fuck okay Okay, no we lost Let's um and of course Cupsy hits a banger Stanford block chain accelerator meanwhile we're buying Fucking bullshit, we haven't gotten anything that hey grow those food ones were so good We should have ended that shit right on the food ones. I'm not gonna lie The next one the next one is the one bro Quadrants gonna fucking read whoa. Oh My god It's my reading Where was our average entry $47,000 market cap we're already up a 2x on this We're already up a 2x on this I Wonder what's gonna happen Dev already sold to Some people have nine racks and that that must that might be us. We might be one of the top holders Keep our eyes out this is this has to be our final final play last hope Oh Imagine this bitch cooks though Cupsy hasn't even been able to sell yet. I like that. We got in this bitch with cups. You know wonder this bitch ran That's right We got next bro Are you gonna are you waiting to be able to like? I don't know we got to see what type of flow this What's that We're in with like equals no we're in more so than he's in with nine so we're in with 15 We're up to x though so that this would literally make us 15 okay wait now. We need this to go way higher Okay fuck me bitch ass cup see bro. Oh my god Everybody selling Give me a bull run pro Cups it just sold the shit's over Get the jeets out Oh wow that rate does pro that's gotta be a wrap Yeah, we're at 40 soul now All right, let's let's let's talk to the people now. Let's break down kind of our Over all opinions experiences on On the meme coin shit. So what did we lose 15k? Wait, we actually we lost 15k Okay, so I Bro so we damn that's real life money bro. That's not like that's That's like taking your job not the dinner like time be straighting Yeah, that's that's Okay, well we let's wrap this shit up you gotta get back to 50 Not bro, we've been recording for two hours All right, so we ended up losing 15,000 dollars we started with 25k so at least we didn't lose all of it I think there was a lot of learning experiences. I think at the end of the sweet spot. It's five soul clearly Like because slippage just fucks you if you go any higher We not we did make some really good plays and we were up I mean well at the end of the day are max like two so yeah was two soul no we can't bro we hit like 20k in a row or something to run back which was fire like 15k those Dorito plays were yeah exactly like our max our max overall net P&L was like two soul, but We hit a couple crazy we hit that goes back to back plays the food plays were definitely our best play as possible So after going through this you think you'll you'll do this shit ever again or not Pro to be honest like Losing that shit was like really Even though it's fucking like three like literally fully on your time super devastating to see the soul just start trickling out the wallet But boy, let me tell you when those candles are green If you're in my bitch I'm gonna have no other option, but to set up some shit on Nova tonight. Yeah, shout out Nova fucking trading bot If we weren't if we were better traders with the meme coin shit We would be able to cook but they I mean shit they helped us avoid probably way more losses than we would have had in the first place Yeah, if we were trying to do that should anywhere else. I don't even know what Could it came out of that shit? All right, well guys. I appreciate y'all if you guys want to use Nova The little chrome extension that we were using on photon will leave a little link down in the description Shout out to orangey for putting me on to all of this game. I don't have the fucking code with Nova It was just a super useful tool for this fun ass video that we had planned so But that being said, I love and appreciate you guys. I'll catch you guys in the next one peace out pros

=== VIDEO 31/34 : The Science Based Trading Strategy That Made Me $291,456 This Month-KxBRLErkel0.txt
============================================

What is good, bros? This is going to be a video going in-depth on how I was able to make $291,000 with a new aggressive trading strategy. I'm going to be covering it from A to Z to explain to you guys this new kind of aggressive scalping strategy that a lot of you guys have been asking me about how I find entries and exits and then a couple examples of how to find it on the charts. So with that being said, we'll just jump straight into this. Again, if you guys want to fact check all of this, I post literally every single trade that I take from market open to entries and exits and showing you guys P&L and all of that in trade recaps that are posted live on YouTube where I'm literally saying, hey, I'm entering right here. Hey, I'm exiting right here. This is how much I made today. This is how much I lost today. So you guys can go back over through the past month and then double check this. And yeah, with that being said, let's jump it in the charts and we will get into it. First thing that I want to explain, I mean, there's a lot of things that I got to explain for real. The first thing that I want to mention, this is in aggressive trading strategy. So this isn't just a full abandonment of my higher time frame strategy where I'm on the five minute timeframe. I'm looking for break of structure, fair value gap breaker block, equilibrium, order block, fill and then scale down to the one minute time frame and then find entries from there. Okay, that is still completely valid. One of my least favorite things is when you guys see a new strategy video by me and I know this shit's going to happen with this video. So just please keep this in mind. This does not mean that that old strategy that I was using and I still use to this day is just done. It's nerfed. It's it's over. Okay, it doesn't work anymore. It still works perfectly fine. And I still use it on a daily basis. But this strategy is something that I use when I'm trying to find aggressive entries and when I'm super sure and super set on a strong bias for the day. For example, like if we have a super strong, strong liquidity or five, a super strong bias of where price is going to go. This strategy gives me the opportunity to get skin in the game before that five minute kind of slower, but safer, higher time frame entry strategy gives me the opportunity to enter. And this more aggressive strategy lets me get skin in the game with the potential to lose because again, it's more aggressive. It's on the lower time frames, but when I have a super strong bias, I am willing to put some risk on the table because if I have a strong bias, I don't want to be left out of the move and be sitting there being like damn. I knew exactly where the market wanted to go today, but I didn't make any money. I wish I could have entered. And that's exactly why I even started trading this way. So that's the first thing. The second thing that I want you guys to keep in mind is when I am entering this way, I am de-risking. So the first thing that I kind of want to lay out for you guys is just like thought process on all of this. So the first thing is I have to have a strong bias with strong draw on liquidity. Okay, and then the second thing is I'm going to be de-risking. And the reason behind this is one because it's an aggressive entry. Okay, this is something where it's not nearly as safe as entering on the five minute and waiting for a whole bunch of confirmations to know for sure that the move is going to go in our direction. But with the strong bias, it gives us the opportunity to potentially make far more or just make money. And if the five minute entry doesn't even present itself, then I can still make money on my strong bias for the day. But with that in mind, I want to leave some risk for me to be able to play with. In case this entry gets stopped out because again, it's aggressive. And my overall strong bias still plays out in the five minute more safer, more confidence strategy plays out. So I can still enter on that. On top of that, this is the best case scenario. If I'm able to get the aggressive entry, I enter there with the de-ris position. So around like half of what I'm willing to risk for the day, then the five minute entry presents itself. Then I can enter with the rest of the risk that I was willing to put on for the day to then encapsulate the entire risk of what I wanted to put on as a whole for the day. Okay, so this I'm de-risking. I have to have a strong bias because again, that's the only reason why I even want to take this aggressive entry. And then on top of that, I want to risk less than I'm willing to risk on the entire day so that one, I can have the opportunity to, if I get stopped out on the aggressive entry, re-enter with the safer five minute strategy. And or enter with the one minute strategy, this aggressive entry strategy that I'm going to show you guys today. And then on top of that, be able to get a second position with our safer, higher time frame confluence. And that's the best case scenario where we get both of them where I can get an aggressive entry. That has a really good risk to reward. And then on top of that, get the five minute entry, which is our safer, more calmer, confluence strategy that will give us still a good risk to reward and still get profits. But not as crazy as what this new strategy that I've been incorporating for this past month will give me. So again, those are just some things that I want to get out of the way before we jump straight into this. So now that we've got that out of the way, I want to, or actually, I'll leave this up here. I want to break down really what I'm looking for before we put it onto the charts. So what am I looking for when I'm looking to try and enter aggressively? Okay, so the first thing is, again, strong bias and strong draws on liquidity. Okay, and if you guys don't know what I'm talking about when I say having a strong bias or what's the liquidity, what's a fair value gap, what's a break of structure, what's an order block, what's a breaker block, what's equilibrium, what's an inverse fair value gap? I have a full free course. Again, you guys don't have to pay anything for it. You guys can click, click the link in the description where I teach you guys all about these confluences online for absolutely free. So you guys can understand these confluences. It's a really long video because again, day trading is just like a whole new language. I know already what I'm talking about can be a little bit overwhelming. So just go through that free course, watch all of that and then come back to this video and it'll make way, way, way more sense. So first of all, I want a strong bias and strong draws on liquidity because without that, there's no reason for me to even be trying to take an aggressive trade. If I have a weak bias or if I'm like, oh, price could go in either direction here. Why would I want to try and take an aggressive trade entry? It doesn't make sense, especially if I see the markets choppy. Okay, there has to be a strong bias in place. So on top of that, there has to be two draws on liquidity and that comes in the form of either a high time frame, draw on liquidity, going towards low time frame, low resistance. And I'll explain what this is liquidity or to another form of high time frame liquidity. So that's the first option. High time frame draw, a high time frame key level price goes there and then we're looking for it to seek out either. A low time frame low resistance strong liquidity or another form of high time frame liquidity and or. Okay, so we're going to flip it back around low time frame, low resistance liquidity to high time frame draw on liquidity. Okay, and again, these draws on liquidity have to be strong. So it can't just be again, I'll show, I'll show good examples of this because this past month has been just awesome for using the strategy. That's kind of why I want to break it down. A lot of you guys have been freaking out in the comments, oh my god, new strategy. You're not trading the way. Shut up. I'm going to tell you guys how to do it. Okay, be quiet. All right. I know you guys have been feeding for this shit. I'm delivering. Okay, calm down, Pipsqueaks. Okay, number two, what else do I need? So once we can establish that we have a strong bias and we have strong draws on liquidity, whether it be price going into a high time frame draw and then targeting low time frame, low resistance draws on liquidity. Or another high time frame draw or low time frame, low resistance liquidity to a high time frame draw from there. What are we looking for? We're looking to scale down to the lower time frames, ideally the one minute. That's how I've been trading this and it's been working great. And then from there, I'm literally just looking for one, a confirmation confluence. If you guys know what that is, that's looking for break of structure inverse her value gap or a closure. Above the 79% extension. And I'll show you guys what that is because I haven't really fully explained that in a YouTube video just yet. Lots of sauce that's going to be dropped in this video. We're putting you guys on game recently with these YouTube videos. Hopefully you guys have been appreciating this. So again, look for a break of structure or an inverse her value gap or a closure above the 79% extension off of one of those strong draws on liquidity. From there, what am I looking for? A continuation confluence. Okay, so what does this establish? We want to understand why we're even entering in the first place. This is kind of what I do with all of my strategy videos. I want to break down why we're even entering off of things in the first place. Because it's one thing for you guys to just like copy and paste this strategy and then being like, oh my god, it didn't work. But I want you guys to actually understand why you're entering. I don't want you guys to see this and just be like, TJR said it so bet. I'm going to do it and just not understand why you're even entering in the first place. I want you guys to understand the thought process of why we are entering the way that we are. So when we're hitting the high time frame draws, obviously that means, hey, profits are either going to be taken here or this is a, this is a point where price is going to reverse and continue the overall higher time frame trend. So that's the first reason why we're looking for a strong bias and strong draws on liquidity. Or from low time frame, low resistance liquidity, we are looking for price to sweep that out and then fulfill the higher time frame draw on liquidity. So I know it's a lot of words, but we're going to explain it on the chart a little bit later in this video. So you guys can actually put the pieces together and I'll actually draw this out for you guys so you can visualize it before we get into the charts. So when we're going from low resistance liquidity, we're pretty much seeing that, okay, price, especially when we have a high time frame draw on liquidity, that's like a super obvious strong bias again. We see price go up and take out low time frame liquidity. It's obvious that price is sweeping out that liquidity to go and fulfill the high time frame draw because again, that's our strong bias. And then with this, when we're taking out a high time frame draw, there's one of two options that price is going to do. It's either going to take profits off of that high time frame draw. So again, if we're going down and sweeping out a high time frame draw on liquidity like this, more often than not, we see profit taking, whether that be on the low time frame to just go seek out low time frame resistance liquidity. Again, that's why we have that there. To just be able to have some profits get taken off of all of these orders that just got filled from the liquidity being swept. Or it's a reversal into again, to push price towards the higher time frame trend. And I'll show you guys examples of all three of these, okay. Regardless, when we take out high time frame draws on liquidity, more often than not, we see profit taking to either go up towards low time frame liquidity, or just to continue the higher time frame trend towards high time frame liquidity. Okay, so that kind of covers step one of this. And then step two, why are we scaling down to the lower time frame to be able to, again, catch that pretty much bottom tick of where we're going to be looking for profits to be taken. Because again, if we come underneath a high time frame draw on liquidity, profits are going to be taken from this move down, right. Price was seeking out these lows to what? Fill their orders, okay, for them to be able to exit. So when they exit, profits get taken. What does that cause price to do? Move up. So because of that, we're trying to either capitalize on that small move up, whether that just be a small little relief bounce up to low time frame resistance liquidity. Or we catch the bottom to send price higher towards the high time frame draw on liquidity all the way up here. Regardless, there is going to be profit taking underneath high time frame draws. And that's why we want to scale down to the lower time frames so that we can capitalize on those bottom tick moves, whether it's a small move up, just to send price lower, or whether it's a big move up to send price higher on the higher time frame. And then how can we confirm that price actually wants to move higher? Well, we wait for our consequences, like a break of structure, because again, if we're pushing down underneath these lows, we are going to be in a downtrend. So what are we going to look for the trend to do? Break trend, break current order flow to send price higher, okay? Or we're looking for an inverse fair value gap. What does that show us? That shows us that hey, the bearish order flow that we were in, it got closed above. We're disrespecting the bearish order flow after coming it down here to take out these orders. Awesome. We're going to send price higher or a closure above the 79% extension on the Fibonacci, which again is another example of us disrespecting bullish order flow to what send price higher. And then that leads us into step number four to show continuation off of that. So it's one thing to just say like, okay, bullish order or bearish order flow got broken, but we want to see continuation. So if we get a break of structure, it's like, okay, cool. That could still be just a retracement on the five minute to send price lower. So what do we want to see on top of that continuation from either a fair value gap getting filled, equal liberium getting filled, order block getting filled, a breaker block getting filled, and then price reacting off of that to send price to either the low timeframe, low resistance draw liquidity or the high time frame drawn liquidity. So let me go ahead and add that on here. Their value gap, equilibrium, breaker block, order block, and a closure in the direction. Awesome. And then last but not least, ended that bit. And then when we're looking to exit on both again, stop loss, anti profit, because again, this is the potential to lose. This isn't 100% full win rate strategy, okay. When we're exiting at low timeframe, low resistance liquidity or high time frame liquidity, okay. And then when we're looking for stop loss, so that's for take profits. And then for stop loss, we're looking to exit where fade idea gets in. Hello, hello, dude. And I'll show you guys examples of what that looks like as well. Okay, so now that we have a full breakdown of this strategy, this is where I'm going to kind of draw out every single scenario here. So you guys can get a good picture and then we'll go into the chart and fully break that down as well. So now let's draw this out. Let's start off with this one right here. We'll keep it short and sweet. Imagine we have a high time frame draw on liquidity right here. Let's say it's a four hour low, okay. And we're really close to that four hour low. This is market open. What are we looking for? High time frame draw on liquidity to get hit. And then following that, looking to target low time frame, low resistance liquidity or high time frame liquidity. Ideally, both. That would be great. So market opens, we come down, sweep out this high time frame liquidity. Okay, awesome. Let's say that we have relative equal five minute highs right here or just three stacked up trend line liquidity. Okay, that is low resistance liquidity. Again, I'll show you guys what that looks like on the chart. But we have low resistance liquidity right here. And then let's say we have a four hour high right here and an hourly high right here. Awesome. We have our exit points. We come underneath. Boom. This high time frame draw from there. What are we looking for? Either a break of structure to the upside on the one minute or an inverse for value gap on the one minute or 79% extension closure. Okay, I'll show you guys what that looks like on the chart. I won't like draw it out because it's kind of impossible to draw it out without having the chart up. And then following that, let's say we just get a break of structure. Awesome. What are we looking for? Either a fair value gap entry after a candle closure to the upside. Equilibrium from this low up to this high. Boom. We come in there. Candles to closure. A order block entry, order block right here or a breaker block entry breaker block right here. And again, if you guys want to understand these concepts, there's going to be a free course in the description for you guys to check out. Then once we get those enter that bit and then exits are going to be again above these three highs. Okay, and then this hourly high and then this four hour high, those can be our targets. Okay, now let's go over what it would look like in the opposite direction. So let's say we have low time frame low resistance liquidity getting swept towards our high time frame draw on liquidity. So again, let's say that we have a strong bias towards this high time frame draw on liquidity and we're really close to it. Same situation. And let's say we have, boom, two relative equal five minute highs right here or three five minute highs that generate low resistance draws on liquidity. Market opens and instead of going down to take out these lows and look for longs out of that, we go up and we sweep out the low time frame low resistance draw on liquidity from there. What are we looking to do because we hit this? We're targeting the high time frame draw, which is right here. So we go up, we take those out, then what do we look for? Break of structure, inverse for value gap. So again, we want to see a break of structure that downside a inverse for value gap or a closure above or below the 79% extension. And then from there, what are we looking for? For value gap, boom, candle closure, enter that bit, equilibrium, boom, enter that bit, breaker block, order block, all that good stuff. And then our one and really only target should just be boom, this high time frame draw because that was our strong bias from the day. Awesome. Now let's go into the chart and then show you guys what this actually looks like with real candlesticks. Okay, so this was a very good example of using the strategy from last week. This was on Tuesday. Again, if you guys want to see the full trade recap breakdown of me actually entering this trade live, you guys can. It's on YouTube for you guys to check out. So again, this is market open. We had this four hour low. So we had our high time frame draw on liquidity right here. And just like in those examples, we were super close to that four hour low pre market open. And then if we look at the S&P 500, we were also super close to this four hour low right here. We actually didn't end up hitting it. I'm going to show you guys the trade entry on NASDAQ because it's way more in line with how I'm teaching the strategy I entered on the S&P 500 because I was using an SMT divergence, which again, I go into in the free course for if you guys want to learn that confidence, that's great. It's not necessary for the strategy though. And I'll show you guys why. So again, I just want to preface I took this trade on the S&P 500 where we didn't sweep out the four hour low, but I'll break down how you guys could have entered this trade on NASDAQ where we actually did sweep out the four hour low. So pre market open, what do we have? High time from drawing liquidity. Okay, cool. What else did we have? We actually had two versions of this setup. So this was awesome. So during pre market, we also had, look at this, five minute highs that were stacked up together. So what is this? This is low resistance liquidity. So I want to do a brief breakdown on what low resistance liquidity is. Low resistance liquidity is essentially a stack of highs that are all pretty close to each other where there's orders to be filled up here, orders to be filled right here, and orders to be filled right here. So if we're thinking in the market standpoint, why would the market want to just go up and take out one singular high and only fill one set of orders when it could just go through and take out all of these highs, fill all of those orders and then push price in the direction that it wants to go, right? It doesn't really make too much sense. It would ideally want to take out all of them. So that's what low resistance liquidity is. It's where we have orders to be filled here, orders to be filled here, and then orders to be filled here where the market probably isn't going to want to take out just one of these highs and then move lower, especially because these highs are so close, it's ideally going to want to take out every single one of them and then push, push lower. Same thing in the opposite direction. If we have lows that are stacked up right next to each other, what is this? This is low resistance liquidity. Why is it called low resistance liquidity? Because it's easy for the market to just come through and sweep out all of these lows at once rather than again, it just doesn't make sense for price to only want to come down and take out one low and then move up when it could get three times the amount of orders by taking out all of them all together. And there's actually a good example of this. This was a prime time example day. There's a good example of this on the high time frame on this day and on the low time frame. So on the high time frame, we can see there's a low right here, a low right here, and a low right here. So what is this? This is, and this is why people call it trendline liquidity because it's boom, low, low, low. Okay, it's like lows that are stacked up together in a trend. So we see low, low, low, and then we also have a low all the way down here. Why is this low not a part of this? Because obviously there's a huge gap in between it. Again, there's another really good example of this right here. Low, low, low, and low. Look what the market does. It wants to take out every single one of these two push price higher. It's low resistance liquidity. It's easy for price to just come down, take out all of those lows and then send price higher. Okay, so again, why did market only want to take out these three lows and not this one all the way down here because these three were stacked up. So again, that gives us an even stronger bias of why this would be a high time for draw on liquidity because it's the last low that price needs to take out along with being a four hour low. Okay, so from there, we can go ahead, let me, let me remove these five minute highs really quick and we can go ahead and mark out our other draws on liquidity. We have an hourly high right here. We have an hourly high and hourly high right here and hourly high right here and then on the five minute, we have low resistance liquidity all stacked up right here. Again, why is this high not grouped with these ones because these ones are stacked up close to each other and this one, there's just a little bit too much of a gap between it. Okay, so this is trend line liquidity, low resistance liquidity. So what do we see price do? There again, there's like pretty much two entries on this. I don't like entering right when the market opens, but this is like a perfect example of both ways to trade this. So this can actually be our example for the opposite way as well where we take out low resistance liquidity to go ahead and target our high time frame draw. What does price do? It opens and then what do we do? We push up, we take out low resistance liquidity. What can we do? We scale down to the one minute time frame. Okay, why are we able to do this? Because we have this high time frame draw down here and then what are we looking for? Either a break of structure and inverse for value gap. This one, it looks like we get a break of structure right here on the one minute and then from there, unfortunately, it doesn't look like any of our continuation confluence got hit. We really would have been looking for this for value gap to get filled, which it didn't equilibrium or a breaker block or an order block, but it didn't get filled. But as you can see, price goes ahead and targets this high time frame draw. So that's low resistance to high time frame draw. Now let's show the actual trade, the good trade example that we would be looking for. So we come down, we take out the high time frame draw. Awesome. Check. What do we do? Scale down to the lower time frames. What are we waiting for? Boom. One minute break of structure. One minute inverse for value gap. We get both of them and we get the 79% extension hit. So I'll break down all of those right now. We get boom, a one minute break of structure. We close above this high after taking out the high time frame draw. What else do we get? We get this bearish fair value gap to get inverse. And then on top of that, this is the 79% extension disrespection. So you pretty much draw it just like a regular Fibonacci. So you take it from the high down to the low. As if you guys are drawing a equilibrium, I'll go ahead and show my settings, because I know you guys just love figuring out what type of settings I use on my chart. These are the settings that I use. Take a screenshot. You guys can use this for later. Okay. And then all that we're looking for, if we don't get an inverse for value gap or if we don't get a break of structure to the upside, we get all three of those confirmation conflumences. All that I'm looking for is price to close above the 79% extension, which it does right here. Awesome. Following that, what are we looking for? We're looking for either equilibrium to get hit, fair value gap to get hit, and then a bullish closure out of that. So again, we get a little move down right here. What is this? A bullish for value gap. We fill it. And then boom, Candle-Sit Closer to the top side, long John Silver that bit, long that bit. And then what can we go ahead and target? Look at this. All of our other highs that we had marked out. Boom. Low resistance strong liquidity. Boom. Hourly draw on liquidity. Boom. Hourly draw on liquidity. Boom. Hourly draw on liquidity. All of that shake. It's smacked work for laterally a 1 to 4.8 risk reward ratio. And in this case, our five minute strategy did not present an entry until after these two draws on liquidity got hit. And at that point, I'm not willing to take the trade on the five minute timeframe because it's just so late in the day and the moves already been made. And we've already taken out areas where profit should be taken. So this is why this strategy is so useful because again, if I hadn't been able to find an entry with this, then I knew where the market wanted to go, but I wouldn't have been able to take a trade. And on top of that, we get a really good risk reward compared to probably like half, if not less than half of the risk reward on a higher time frame, more confluence safer trade by trading with this strategy. So that like that was just like freaking prime time of literally the aggressive trade entry strategy. Okay, we long off of the candle closure out of this. We come into the high time from draw on liquidity. We see a break of structure. We see an inverse for value gap. What are we looking for out of that? We also got, or sorry, no, we didn't fill this order block, but this was the order block right here. Did we fill the breaker? Okay, yeah, we literally two steps into this breaker block right here, just barely pretty much make equal highs and lows with this breaker block. We don't hit equilibrium, but we don't need every single one of those to get hit for us to be able to enter. So this was absolutely prime time, super gorgeous example. Now let's go ahead and let's find an example of us taking out low resistance draws on liquidity, going down towards a high time frame draw on liquidity because this one was a pretty good example of us coming up and taking out these low resistance highs towards the high time frame draw, but we weren't able to find an entry. So we'll go ahead and do that now. Okay, so this is going to be another actually really good example of both pretty much both directions of the low time frame, low resistance liquidity getting swept out towards a high time frame draw. And then on top of that, high time frame draw towards low resistance draws on liquidity or another high time frame draw. And this is going to be showcasing this with the example that I showed before. And this is on the S&P 500 now. So coming into market open, what do we notice? We see a whole bunch of high time frame draws on liquidity stacked up. So this is high time frame low resistance draws on liquidity now. If we go into the lower time frames, okay, what do we have? We have these lows that hadn't been hit during pre-market, these lows that hadn't been hit during pre-market. And then we have some hourly highs up here. And then when we go into the five minute, we can go ahead and see that we have the low time frame high right here. So we see, look at this, man, so good. So freaking good. Market opens, we come up, we sweep out this five minute high. Okay, awesome. Low resistance liquidity gets hit with our obvious high time frame draws draws on liquidity in mind. Again, if we think back to our rules, we need two draws on liquidity, whether that be low resistance to a high time frame draw or a high time frame draw towards low resistance or another high time frame draw. Okay, so in this case, we actually, there's hits in both directions. We have a high time frame draw towards another high time frame draw and low resistance towards a high time frame draw. But which one gets hit first, low resistance towards the high time frame draw. So again, on the five minute, we come through, we sweep out this five minute high from there. Cool. Step one, complete. Why are we able to scale down because we know that, hey, these are high time frame draws. It's obvious that this is the overall draw on liquidity for the day. Why do we know that? Because we've already came through, we took out this low, we took out this low. These are high time frame lows that are stacked up, low resistance draws on liquidity. What is the market going to want to do? It's going to want to take out this low, this low, and these lows. Why? Because there's more orders for rice to go through and get filled. Now, this is also during a time that I wouldn't necessarily be willing to trade. But it's a really good example of this. So I'll show it in actually both directions because, hey, bro, I crafted this bitch so good. Okay. We come up, we sweep out the five minute high from there. What are we looking for? Either a one minute break of structure, one minute inverse for value gap, 79% extension closure. Boom. We get a break of structure. We also get an inverse for value gap and we get this 79% extension closure. From there, what else can we look for? We can look for a breaker block. We can look for order block. Okay. So we've an order block right here. That doesn't get hit. We have the breaker right here. That barely gets missed. We can see if equilibrium gets hit. Equilibrium does get hit and this fair value gap comes through and gets filled. We come up. We fill the fair value gap and equal to room gets hit. We get a candle closure out of that. Boom. Shortdive it. And in this case, because we have two high time frame draws on liquidity, we can go ahead and target both of them. Now, unfortunately, this isn't like the best restore reward ratio, but also, okay, this is actually something nice because we know that these high time frame draws on liquidity are technically low resistance draws on liquidity. We can get rid of this one and just set this as our one and only take profit because we know that price is going to want to take out both of them. So we can go ahead and just disregard this low because if it's going to take out this low, which we know it wants to, it's also going to want to take out this one. Why? Because they're stacked up and it wants four orders rather than just three. So price goes down. Boom. Take profit gets hit. And then what can we do also in the other direction? I don't want to advocate for over trading, but what can we also see in the other direction? High time frame draw on liquidity gets hit. Now, what do we have to the top side? We have boom. High time frame draws. We also have this five minute high right here that was made right at market open. High time frame draw gets hit. What are we waiting for? We're waiting for a break of structure inverse for value gap. We get a break of structure right here, but we come back down. We don't get any continuation confluence off of it. So what do we do? We continue waiting. Boom. We get a break of structure to the upside. We also get an inverse bearish for value gap. Cool. We get a 79% extension closure above. Then following that, what do we get? Boom. Fair value gap gets hit. Boom. This order block gets hit. Boom. This breaker block gets hit. Boom. Equilibrium gets hit. We see a bullish candle closure out of that. Awesome. Long that bitch. Boom. We can either put stops right underneath these lows underneath this candlestick. And then from there, what can we do? We can literally just target these highs. That's like just our first take profit. One to three point four risk or reward ratio. Smack work. And if we really want to hold that bitch, one to eight risk or reward ratio. Fucking smack work. Hey, bro. All I'm going to say this works really well. And then I'm pretty sure on this day, we got our high time frame strategy to work as well. Yes, we did. Look at this. So again, this oh, baby, it's getting juicy. This aggressive, we put half of our risk on because we have this super strong bias, right? From there, what can we do? We can wait for our five minutes set up to then develop. What do we get? A five minute break of structure. Oh, man, it's so good. Five minute break of structure, five minute fair value gap, five minute fair value gap gets filled, scaled out of the one minute in there. And the reason why I would be willing to enter on this is because, boom, this draw on liquidity hasn't been taken out yet. If this draw on liquidity had been taken out, then I would just take profits on this and be completely satisfied. But it hadn't been taken out. Then what do we wait for? Just a one minute break of structure to the upside or again, a 79% extension closure or a inverse fair value gap. We get a break of structure. Boom, long that stops underneath here. Bro. One to eight risks reward, one to 4.7 risks reward. Higher, safer entry here. More aggressive, more risky entry here, but we literally get like so much more profits from this. And that is how I find aggressive trade entries. I really appreciate you guys for watching to the end of this video. If you guys have very personalized questions, like about all of these confluences, about how I trade and you guys are just like, man, these YouTube videos are awesome. But I want to be able to talk to you one on one. I want to be coached by you or coached by other profitable traders. I'll leave a little link in the description for you guys to be personally coached by me and other profitable traders where you guys can get on a call with us literally every single weekday to be able to answer your guys' questions so we can teach you guys strategies like this. My mentorship has had this strategy for the past, I want to say like month and a half now where I've been able to cover this for them. But again, they take priority over YouTube videos just because again, they are paying for my services and they are my top priority to turn them into profitable traders. And then again, I have by far the most results, use this, use the free content. By all means, if you guys are just getting introduced, introduce to me, use the free content. See if it works for you. If it works for you, awesome. My job here is completely done. You just learned how to day trade for absolutely free. If you guys are still struggling, if you guys have super personalized questions, if you guys just like need a little bit extra help, if you guys need your guys' hand help, that's what I'm here for. I'll leave another link in the description. If you guys want to become one of my students, if you guys want to be mentored by me personally, I love and appreciate you guys. I'll catch you guys in the next one. This one was a freaking banger. Peace out.

=== VIDEO 32/34 : The_ONLY_Break_Of_Structure_Video_You_ll_Ever_Need-[jeewXSLHt2g].txt
============================================

This is the only break of structure video that you guys will ever need. I'm going to explain what a break of structure is, how to spot it, and then how you guys can start taking trades with it. So you guys can finally turn comfortable. My name is CJR. I've made over seven figures day trading at the age of 23. And literally every single trade that I take has a break of structure involved with it. So with that being said, let's jump out of the charts and let's get into it. So the very first thing that we need to understand is what is a break of structure or for short, B-O-S, okay, break of structure. So what is a break of structure? The definition is literally in the name. It's a trend change, okay? It is the current market structure breaking, okay? It's showing a change in order flow. It's showing a change in trend. It's showing a change in structure. All of those are literally the same exact thing. So what is it? It is a trend change. It's a confluence that shows us when the trend is changing and when the trend or the current trend that we're in is changing and breaking structure into a new trend. So in order to understand what a break of structure is, we need to understand what a trend is, okay? So we're going for definition into another definition. As you guys know, this is super, super simple day trading knowledge. There's three different ways that the market can move in an uptrend. How do we identify an uptrend with higher highs and higher lows, okay? And then the second way that the market can move is in a down trend with lower highs and lower lows. The third way that the market can move is through consolidation where we are pretty much just moving sideways. There's no identifiable trend. And that is where we will be able to identify breakouts in, which is a form of a break of structure. But it's a little bit different than how we identify a break of structure within these current trends. But I'm going to show you guys how to identify a break of structure within an uptrend. Within a down trend, and then also how to spot a break out from consolidation or that sideways movement. So it is a trend change. So now that we know what a trend is, we know that an uptrend moves in higher highs and higher lows. And a down trend moves in lower highs and lower lows. We also need to understand what a high and what a low is. We're going even deeper. So we go for definition to definition to definition. And then once we understand what a high and a low is within the market. And I know you guys might think you guys know what it is. But a lot of people believe it or not, this is one of the most difficult confluences for them to understand. It's crazy. It's one of the easiest confluences in my mind to understand and get. But a lot of people mix it up and I have no freaking clue why. But I'm going to make this as simple as possible for you guys. This is why we're going through all these definitions first. So what is a high within the market? It is a move up and then a move down. So that means it's a green candle followed by a red candle. What is a low within the market? It is a move down, then a move up, a red candle, then a green candle. And we take the lowest point of those two candlesticks, whichever, wick or body that the lowest point gets to. And then whichever the highest point that either the body or those two candlesticks formed gets to, that's a high and that's a low question here. Is a high a green candle, then a green candle? No, because there hasn't been a move down yet. A red candle is a low, a move down, and then another move down. No, because there needs to be an up candle to form the law. Believe it or not, some people do not understand this. I know this may seem beginner to some of you guys, but it really is ridiculous how some people do not understand this. So now that we understand all the definitions to be able to create what a break of structure is, the definition, we know what a trend is, we know that trends are created by higher highs and higher lows and lower highs and lower lows. And we know that the trend has to change, and that is what defines a break of structures. So now we're going to find the definition of a trend change. How does a trend change? Well, if we are in an uptrend making higher highs and higher lows, how would this trend change? Well, it's no longer an uptrend if we end up making a lower low and then a lower high, right? Because that qualifies as a downtrend, okay? So in turn, what is a break of structure? It's when the current trend that we are in breaks, okay? Changes and within an uptrend, how can we identify when the uptrend is broken or changes when a low gets closed underneath? So again, how do we identify uptrends, higher highs and higher lows? Boom, we're in an uptrend. When does this trend change? Once we close underneath the most recent low within the uptrend. Now within a downtrend, we're making lower highs and lower lows. When does this trend change? Or when does this trend break structure? When we close above the most recent high within the trend? Why? Because that is not following the trend rules. What is a trend? A downtrend? Lower highs and lower lows. What is an uptrend? Higher highs and higher lows. When this low gets closed underneath, we are no longer in an uptrend. When this high gets closed above, we are no longer in a downtrend. Okay? And that is what a break of structure is. Now, believe it or not, I'm sure a lot of you guys are like, I got this. I'm sure you guys don't, because a lot of my students, they still, for whatever reason, are unable to identify these things. And I think it's due to their in capability of being able to identify trends on a chart. Because the chart isn't going to look as clean as just like higher highs and higher lows, moving up, lower highs and lower lows, moving down, we need to be super good at being able to identify these trends in real time. So right now, we're in a whole bunch of consolidation on the S&P 500. I'm going to make this a little bit easier. Let's just go into like a higher time frame about this. I also want to find some examples that we can use. Yes, so this is gorgeous. So let's go in trying to find a clean example to start you guys off with. Okay, this is good right here. So let's just look at this area of price right now. And we'll start from right here. So let's think that we are right here. What is the current trend that we're in? So we're looking from the left side over to this line. What is the current trend that we're in? Well, it's pretty easy to say we're in a downtrend. Why? Because price is moving down. But let's look at the candlestick anatomy to actually prove that we are in a current downtrend. So let's just start right here. We have a low and then we have a high. And then we have a low right here. Now again, let's get into the anatomy even more so here and look at this. What consists of a low, a move down than a move up, black candle than a blue candle. We take the lowest point of those two candles. Boom, it's this week. Then we have a high, a move up than a move down. Boom, then we have another low move down than a move up. Now this is the most recent low. It's this low. It's lower than this one. Then we have a high, a move up than a move down. Before I do that, trick question or not trick question question for you guys. Is this the high? Is this a high on the current timeframe that we're on? No, no, no, it's not. It is not a high. Maybe on the lower timeframes, it is a high. Actually, I'm sure of it on the lower timeframes, it's a high. But on the current timeframe that we're in, on the four hour timeframe, this is not a high. Why? Because this is a move down than a move down. That does not make a high. We need a move up, then a move down. So where is our move up? Right here, move down. Boom, this is our high. We take the highest point of these two candles six together. We don't give a fuck about this candle sick. Why? Because there's no move up prior to it. So we have a low, then a high, then a lower low, then a lower high. Okay, we're in a downtrend. Now let's just see this trend continue. We make a lower low, move down, then a move up, move up, then a move down, lower high. Move down, then a move up, move up, then a move down, lower low, lower high. Move down, then a move up, move up, then a move down, lower low, lower high. Okay. We are in a downtrend coming up to this point right here. Now, something that can happen within trends is that we will make a higher low and a lower high. You're like, wait a second, what's fucking trend has a lower high, but also a higher low, lower high, but also a higher low. Still a downtrend. Why? Because the most recent high has not been closed above yet. That's how we identify a break of structure and that's what we're going to be leading into right now. So even though we make a higher low right here, that doesn't change the current downtrend structure that we're in. Okay. That does not change the current downtrend structure that we are in. Okay. It doesn't change anything. Because when we're in a downtrend, what are we doing where we are only monitoring the highs and more specifically the most recent high within the downtrend? So if we make a higher low, we don't really care about it too much. Why? Because if the downtrend is to break structure to the upside, we only need to be monitoring the highs because we very well, just like we see right here, can make a higher low and then the downtrend can continue to end up making a lower low from that low. And that's what I was saying where some people, they get super confused and they get really caught up and they are unable to identify these things. Within a downtrend, we are looking at the most recent high that has been created and we are looking for a candlestick to close above it. That is the only way that we are going to be able to break structure. Okay. And when thin and uptrend, we are looking at the most recent low that has been created and we are looking for a candlestick closure underneath it. That is the only way that we can change the trend. So within this trend, we have this is the most recent high. Okay. Whatever we come down and we take out a low, we don't care about the lows when we are in a downtrend. We care about the highs. So this is our most recent highs and move up and then move down the highs point of those two candles and then what do we get? This candlestick closes above this high right here in turn, changing the trend to the upside. And then boom price moves up. Awesome. Now, let's continue this analysis moving forward in price. So now that we are in an uptrend, what are we doing? We are monitoring the lows. Okay. So we break structure on this candlestick right here. Now we're in an uptrend. So what do we want to do? We want to be monitoring the lows, move down the move up, the lowest point of those two candles. Boom. This is our low. We come up. We obviously make a much higher high than this right here, move up than to move down. This is our high. Then we want to make another low. We make a higher low, move down than to move up. Awesome. This is our low. Then what happens? We get a breaker structure. Within an uptrend, we are monitoring the most recent lows that have been created and we are looking for a candlestick closure underneath them. Boom. This candle closes underneath it. Awesome. We have now changed the trend. We are now in a downtrend. So now within this downtrend, if we are looking for a breaker structure back to the upside, what do we need to be monitoring? The highs. Cool. We move up. Then we make a move down. Now this is the high that we're monitoring. We move up. Then we make a move down. Now this is the high that we're monitoring. When do we break structure back to the upside? Was it on this candlestick right here? This one? Is this a breaker structure? Well price pushed above here for a quick second, right? No. It's not a breaker structure. This is a candlestick wick. We need a full candlestick body clothes above a high or underneath a low, depending on what trend we're in in order for price and break structure. So on this candlestick right here, do we break structure? No. On this candlestick right here, do we break structure? Yes. We break structure and then boom. We're back into an uptrend. Now obviously this confluence, I'm not saying that it is useless. It's one of the most beneficial confluence that we can use. However, if you just try and use it on your on its own by pressing by when we break structure to the upside or pressing sell when we break structure to the downside, you are going to lose all of your money. This needs to be in combination with a bunch of other confluence in order to take a highly probable trade to predict where price action wants to go. And I have a super in-depth guide that is like five and a half hours long that goes through every single one of these confluence and then how to put it together in a strategy. And I'll leave that link in the description below for you guys to go over all those confluence to be able to put them all together to be able to actually take a trade using break of structure. But break of structure on its own is not enough to take a trade. However, it is one of the most important confluence when we are looking to take a trade. Does that make sense? We can't be using break of structure on its own to take trades because the food was that easy. Then this simple confluence would make every single person the richest person in the world. And it's not that simple. Day trading is very difficult. But I have supplied you guys with a whole bunch of confluence such as this one to be able to take highly probable trades within the market in that five and a half hour long video. So you guys should go check that one out if you guys haven't already. Now we know how to identify up trends and down trends. Let's run through a couple more examples here. Let's look at this for example right here. Look at these massive wicks here. This is part of the stuff that I'm talking about where people can get confused. And I know that this can be confusing when you see a candlestick with wicks all the way up here and then wicks all the way down here. This was a high impact news candle. But it's a great example for something that we're looking for. Okay, when it comes to identifying trends. So let's go ahead and start right here on this candlestick. So what's the current trend that we're in? Well, let's say we're on this candlestick. All I do is I look to the left and I look at what previous candles price action was. Well, I see a high right here in this high was closed above by this candle. And then I see a low right here. And if we're just waiting on this candle and say that we don't see anything prior to this, this is an uptrend. Why? Because I'm just looking at the most recent highs in the most recent lows within the market. And the most recent high was closed above and the most recent low hasn't been closed underneath. That's the easiest way to be able to identify trend. You look at the most recent high and you look at the most recent low and you see if the most recent high has been close above and you look at the most recent low and you see if the most recent low has been closed underneath. In this case, we are in an uptrend higher high higher low. Cool. We are in an uptrend. Awesome. This is our low that we're going to be monitoring. I'll go ahead and get rid of this. Boom. We close underneath this low. Now we are in a downtrend. But then just like that, we want to be monitoring the highs. Why? Because we could very well break out of this downtrend back to the upside. From there, as you can see, this is why we don't want to be entering and pressing sell right when we get a break of structure to the downside because there's other confluence that are necessary in order to understand where price wants to go. But we're in a downtrend on this candle. Now we're monitoring the highs to look for a break of structure back to the upside. Awesome. We get a candle closure to the upside right here. Now we're in an uptrend. Okay. Now we're monitoring the lows to see a potential break of structure to the downside. Okay. So this is the most recent low. We identified the current trend. We're in an uptrend wide because this high was close to above. We don't care about the highs because we're in an uptrend right now. And in order for the uptrend to break, we need a low to get close underneath. So move down the move up. Boom. Low is one of those two candles. This is the low that we're targeting. Okay. We get a move down the move up. Awesome. Now this is the most recent low or still going up. Move down the move up. Awesome. Now this is the most recent low. Move down the move up. Do we get a candle stick closure underneath this line here? Underneath the most recent low, we have one week, two week, three weeks underneath this candle stick low right here. But do we get a candle stick closure? No. So this uptrend remains intact. This is not a break of structure. And what are we doing? We're still monitoring the lows. We're looking for new lows to get formed to potentially get broken. So move down the move up. That's a low. We take the lowest point of those two candles. This is the new low that we're monitoring. Move down the move up. If we zoom in, we can see that this is a blue candle. Now this, okay, again, same thing here. This is the low that we're monitoring. We see a candle stick. Wic underneath here. Is this a break of structure? No. We see candle stick wic underneath here. Is that a break of structure? No. And then what do we do? We end up forming a new low. Move down the move up. Now this is the most recent low within this uptrend. This uptrend is still maintained. And this is where a lot of people can get confused as they keep flipping their eyes. They're like, oh, we broke the structure to the downside. And then, oh, we broke the structure to the upside. These are candle stick wics, not candle stick closures. So we are still in the uptrend that was formed on this break of structure right here. And as we can see, prices continuing that trend higher and higher. From there, we have a move down than a move up. Awesome. Now this is the low that we're monitoring. Do we break this? Move down than a move up? Awesome. Now this is the low that we're monitoring. Move down than a move up. Now this is the low that we're monitoring. And then boom, we finally get a break of structure to the downside right here. Again, this is break of structure on its own. This is not going to help us indicate where and when to press sell or where and when to press buy. But we need to understand how these trend, how this confluence is used coinciding with all the other confluence confluence is that I've given you guys across my YouTube channel. So this is a super, super, super powerful confluence that in combination with a liquidity suite in combination with fair value gap in combination with breaker blocks equilibrium. We can help you guys understand where price action wants to go with a high probability on a daily basis. And that pretty much wraps up how you guys can spot a break of structure, what a break of structure is and how you guys can go into the real markets and identify it on the chart. And again, if you guys want to be able to put all of these things together, don't check out that five and a half hour long video. I love and appreciate you guys subscribing if you haven't already. Peace out.

=== VIDEO 33/34 : This Simple Strategy Made Me My First $100k-CPPREA-6ubY.txt
============================================

Most day traders over complicate the game of trading whether they have a whole bunch of indicators on their chart That's telling them hey prices going to go up But also price may or may not go down or they know when they understand 10 different strategies or 30 different Confluences that tell them prices going to go up or no prices going to go sideways or no prices going to go down or no You probably shouldn't be trading for the next week And this is why the majority of traders stay broke and stay Unprofitable within the markets because it's just information overload what I want to show you guys today is the first Ever strategy that helped me turn profitable and help me make my first $100,000 within the market super simple Super easy to understand and I'm not going to go through any fluff any BS We're going to get straight into the charts. So with that being said let's jump into it The first thing that I want you guys to understand before we jump into like confluences and oh my goodness new day trading strategy I can't wait to turn profitable okay like we need to clarify something a lot of people think day trading is this Super mega advanced Impossible skill now. I'm not saying it's going to be super freaking easy for you guys to learn how to day trade and for you guys to become Profitable but what I am going to tell you guys is you just need to master just a couple skills in order to turn profitable within Trading and if you guys want a full breakdown of all the confluences and the strategy that I use currently to make Literally hundreds of thousands of dollars from the market every single year I'm going to leave a little link in the description to give you guys free access to a full in-depth course It's like five and a half hours long for you guys to go over every single confluence that I talk about within this video and also get the current strategy That I'm using today because it's a little bit different than this current strategy that I'm using but this is a very good Starting point to get just get your feet off the ground. So with that being said I want to clarify day trading is very Difficult however, it's not impossible and you don't need to know and understand like frack Doles and quantum physics. Okay, you really just have to master the basics I love comparing day trading to basketball because it's it's super similar Okay, it's a very high leverage skill especially at the professional level. Okay, professional day traders They can make a whole bunch of money professional basketball players. We already know they're making a bankroll Okay, but in order to get to the MBA or in order to be good like max stat and super good at really any skill You just have to be insanely good at the fundamentals So if we think about basketball like what do you have to be good at in order to be successful and go to the MBA? Okay, you have to have really good basketball IQ you have to be really good at passing the ball You have to be really good at dribbling the ball and you have to be really fucking good at shooting the basketball Okay, those are just four freaking skills that you guys need in order to master to be able to get to the high level now Again, there's a difference between 24 hour fitness hoopers who know how to pass who know how to dribble who know how to shoot who have You know sub bar basketball IQ Compared to the people in the MBA who are far better at those base fundamentals Okay, the people in the MBA they're they're doing the same shit But just at a far better level and it's the same exact thing with day trading day trading It's actually even easier because we just have to be good at three skills Okay, we have to understand strategy, which is what I'm about to go over We have to understand risk management Okay, so how much risk we're going to be putting on into the charts on daily basis And I cover that in the free course and then psychology which I also cover in the free course But today I want to focus on the one skill of strategy and confluences and this was able to literally take me from not making any money To being able to actually make money from the market So with that being said let's jump into this and believe it or not before I used to trade indexes only which is the S&P 500 the NASDAQ Okay, you guys know me as a futures and in a US equities trader however today's strategy is actually going to be going over For an exchange okay, and I'm going to show you guys how we can actually relate this over to US equities and Indexes because I know a lot of people that follow me they want to learn how to trade NASDAQ They want to learn how to trade the S&P 500 So I'm going to show you guys not only how we can apply this to 4x because that's what I was originally Trading on during London session, but I'm going to show you guys how we can relate this all the way back over to US equities as well So make sure you guys say to the end of the video so you guys can see that because this isn't just a 4x base video and The 4x traders. I'm finally showing you guys some love so let's jump into this Let's go onto the pair that I used to trade the most which is GBP JPY So the very first thing that we're going to want to do is to highlight the session highs and the session lows of Every single session so I actually have this little indicator that does it for me I know I'll shit talking indicators, but I'm talking about indicators that like tell you when to buy and run to sell those are bullshit This is literally just to help me out and I mean fucking I just have these made for me to make my life a lot easier If you guys want it I'll I'll give you guys like you guys access to it if you guys like really freaking wanted that super duper bad Fuck it. Yeah, I'll I'll put a link in the description if you guys want these things I kind of just keep them for myself though a lot of people were asking about it on stream, but This is what I called the London session fake out So before I even knew about liquidity sweeps and break of structure and fair value gaps Okay, I was training the London session on GBP JPY and GBP USD Those were like my main pairs and what I noticed is I would get into a trade like right before London session would open because I was in Like California at the time so like end of Asian session going into London session was like late for me I was in high school and I was like this is Honestly like fucking perfect time for me to trade even though I didn't really understand that Asian session was a horrible time to trade at the time So every single time I would be getting into Freaking like long position right before London session would open and I'm like yeah We're in an uptrend coming out of Asian session It's beautiful. I'm going to get into a long position and I want to target these highs all the way up here because I want to 1 to 4 risk reward ratio and then what I would notice literally Every single London session was that London session would open and then it would move up Drastically and then it would just go in the opposite direction and every single time it took it and believe it or not I know I was dumb at the time. I was similar a little bit similar to you guys You know you're like why isn't it working and then you just keep making the same mistakes over and over again I'll keep taking these long positions Every single freaking day, bro, and I'll keep getting stopped out and I'm like well what the heck the trend is my friend I'm following the trend and I'm placing a by position in the high time frame says it's going to go higher so what is happening and Then it got to the point where I finally realized like okay I keep making the same mistake every single time so I and I'm sure a lot of you guys have done this before too I was like if I keep getting stopped out what if I just place a trade in the opposite direction So then I started placing Short positions right here instead and I would put my stop loss Above like these highs and then I would target whatever like these lows all the way down here for a 1 to 4 risk reward ratio But then again London session would open and then it would move up and I'm like damn it So my my long positions don't hit take profit and my short positions don't hit take profit and then boom a vision occurred to me one night while I was trading London session I was like wait a second the market is repeating itself every single day and Guys this literally took me months to figure out this is how like little brain cells I had and and guess what if I was able to figure this shit out and I'm able to tell you guys how to do it trust me I believe that you guys will be able to turn profitable because if that level of IQ was able to understand this shit You guys will be able to understand this as well. So I was like wait a second right when London session opens It will it moves up and then it goes in the opposite direction and I'm like whoa This is a London session fake out and again I didn't understand liquidity sweeps. I didn't understand session highs and session lows or any of these things at the time Okay, but that's what I was going off of so then instead of just pressing short and pressing long going into London session What I would do is I would wait for London session to open I would wait for it to make its drastic move and Then yes believe it or not the low IQ that I had I would see like boom it's going up boom press short Whatever stop loss where literally literally not a thought in the world not a single brain cell I'm just like oh it went up. So guess what it's probably gonna go down now and guess what I actually was hitting trades using this now Do I want you guys to follow this to a tea? Absolutely freaking not because there's a lot of other Confluences that I'm going to teach you guys in this video to make this strategy way better and way safer But my win rate started increasing did I turn profitable off of just pressing short right when London session started to go up No, but I was seeing progress. So I was like okay. I'm understanding this I Jump shot. I understand it now. Okay, lethal shooter. All right We know that when London session opens it moves up and then that probably means that London session is going to move down for the day For the most part. Okay, that this is unprofitable me thinking at like literally 2 a.m. At night I understand that so how can I make this a little bit better? Well, I know the trend is my friend until the trend is no longer my friend So what did I do? I was like okay? Well, I want to take a relatively lower time frame trade and what would happen to me is like I would see a move similar to this Right London session would open and it would move up and then I would I would just press short like right here and then You know, I maybe target these lows, but I'll get stopped out like this because obviously I wasn't waiting for any confirmation So those were the losses that I was taking so then I was thinking okay Well, what if I just wait for the five minute to change its trend and then out that That was a game changer for me. So then I was like okay, but we're gonna wait for the London session fake out When London session moves up I know the move for London session is going to move down again This is unprofitable me thinking not smart giga Chad me and I mean But okay, this is unprofitably me thinking London session moves up and then If we just wait for a break of structure then the trend will no longer be our friend and then the trend will In turn turn into our friend because London session fake out and then it's gonna go in our direction gigabrain and This was literally it bro, and I'm going to add other Confluence is to this so we can make this far better But this is literally what helped me turn profitable what helped me pass some of my first funded accounts What helped me get some of my first payouts ever was waiting for this London session fake out And we're going to go more in depth into these confluence is really but we're just breaking down the dumbass me first Wait for the London session fake out and then wait for a five minute change in trend So let's look at this example and this is crazy because look This was literally today's price action and we would have fucking banged on this straight this It's actually crazy that like well, it's not crazy because it works for me But it's just super cool that we can break this down in such a simple manner and show that this works anyways London session fake out we wait for London session to break structure to the downside and Then this is when I would press short and I would all I would do is I would put my stop loss above the high of the London session fake out and I would just go ahead and target Asian session lows One to freaking three-rister award ratio bang work Like what this happens today this literally happened today Are you like okay? So what do we have to understand to be able to be able to like fully Understand the strategy the first thing that we have to understand The session the session times the second thing that we have to understand draws on liquidity So session highs and session lows and break of structure I'm just I'm going to keep it as simple as that for today because genuinely this strategy Turns me profitable now my win rate wasn't crazy I was still taking losses, but this helped me pass funded accounts and this made me a profitable trader by learning and understanding these concepts so the first thing that we need to understand Asian session the time zones, okay? And again, I have this little indicator that is able to mark out the session highs and lows But I don't have something to mark out the time zone so Asian session starts First thing that you guys are going to want to do is change your chart settings to New York time At least if you guys want to align it with mine you guys can have it on like whatever vulgaria time or Fucking Chinese time whatever you guys want, okay? Indian time whatever you guys need but just make sure it aligns with these times that I'm telling you guys Okay, so mine's on UTC minus four New York cool Sorry, okay, so Asian session it opens at 18 on it When does Asian session and technically it ends at three? Okay, London session pre-market starts at two, but we want to market at three So we know when Asian session starts 18 on it it ends at three London session pre-market technically starts at two But starts at three and then it ends at eight because London session ends at 11 30 But it is when New York pre-market starts so we're going to leave it like that because at the end of the day We're really just focused on London session open at least for the foreign exchange part Okay, we're going to get into the US part or US equities and indexes and all that stuff So boom, we have our session time perfect super simple super easy. We mark out these session times awesome Now once we have these session times we're going to want to be able to mark out the highs and the lows of every single session So again, I have my handy dandy indicator that does that shit for me But you guys don't need that shit by any means it just makes my life a trillion times easier So let's remove that for a second and let's go ahead and do it ourselves. So from 18 on it to three we're going to mark out the high whereas the high High of Asian persuasion right here low of Asian persuasion right here and then For this strategy, we don't really need to mark out London session high and London session low because during the foreign exchange hours This is when we're going to be trading But what we do also want to mark out is New York So New York session When does New York session start? eight When is it in? barely This is what we're going to break you out of break you out of the fucking nine five okay nine five seventeen honey Or actually it ends at sixteen honey because look you'll see the gap so eighteen honey look at the Eighteen honey and then we when we jump over to this candle or this is actually spread hour So you can only see it on indexes, but whatever New York is from eight to sixteen honey So Even though this didn't apply for this trade we're still going to want to mark that out as well so we'll go ahead and mark out Oh And then we're going to want to mark out the highs and lows of that as well. So New York high New York low So we understand the session opens we understand the session closes we understand that we're going to want to mark the highs and the lows of every single session Now how do we understand break of structure again? I explained that super in depth in the free course Again link in the description if you guys want to understand that but I'm going to break it down for you guys as well in this video so Market structure What is it so if you guys are little baby boys and you guys don't understand trading at all market moves in Higher highs and higher lows when it's in an uptrend when it's in a downtrend it moves in lower highs in lower lows Cool cool So these are the two ways this is the market moves it also can move sideways But we're not focused on that we're focused on higher highs and higher lows lower highs and lower lows So how do we break in uptrend? How do we break the current market structure? Well if an uptrend gets broken what happens We no longer make higher highs and higher lows We end up making lower lows and lower highs to turn into a downtrend If we're in a downtrend how do we break a downtrend? Well We we literally break it we move past the most recent lower high that was made and we make a higher high And then we make a higher low and then we turn into an uptrend So when we break structure What are we looking for we're looking in an uptrend at the most recent lows that are made within the market We're looking for those to get closed underneath because what is that telling us that's telling us that hey The uptrend is over we broke the uptrend structure when we're in a downtrend What are we looking for we're looking for the most recent lower high to get closed above in order to say hey We broke this downtrend we broke structure to probably continue higher So how can we show this on the chart? I marked it out right here as I was speed running this But let's look so coming into London session we make we have a high right here We have a low a higher high a higher low now. This is a perfect example of what a break of structure is not a low Consist of a move down than a move up and the lowest point of those who candle sick weeks a high Consist of a move up and a move down in the highest point of those who candle sick weeks For us to break structure we have to have a candle close underneath the low So let me just remove this for now So on this right here for our OG London session fake out I probably would have lost this trade If I was just going off of London session went up Okay, now I'm gonna now I'm gonna press sell now would have been stopped out Why because we didn't break structure here move down than a move up This is our low We do see candle stick wicks go underneath here, but do we see this black Do we see this black candlestick close Underneath this low no, we do not we only see wicks go underneath the low And then we continue the uptrend to make a higher high and then what do we do we make a higher low But on this one move down then a move up so we're going to want to mark it out Why because again London session fake out it's moving up right so we're assuming that London sessions Eventually going to move down so with that in mind We're going to want to monitor the lows because we want to see a break in the current uptrend that London session is in move down Then a move up we mark out that low and then what do we see a black Candlestick closure Underneath the low Okay, once we get that That was my sign at the time to just go ahead and enter and I put my stop loss above these highs And then what did I do this is going into More more of the strategy, but boom that's break of structure explained within the strategy So we need to understand the session times we need to understand where the session highs and the lows are We need to understand break of structure Now we need to understand when and where to actually enter With all of these confluences. So let's strip this thing down again And let's remove all of these real quick And let's say We're going into boom London session open. We are going to want to mark out Asian session high We're going to want to mark out Asian session low We're going to want to mark out New York session high And we're going to want to mark out New York low now If Asian session has already pushed past the New York low We no longer care about this level why because it's already been pushed past So we can go ahead and get rid of this Okay, we would only care if New York has a low down here or underneath Asian sessions low Okay, in this down scenario all right so London session opens We push above this high the second That we are able to push above a session high Whether it's Asian session high or New York session high I'm immediately going to the five minute time frame and I'm going to be monitoring these lows So boom we push above Asian session highs I'm monitoring monitoring these lows Do we get a break of structure here? No Now I'm monitoring these lows because these are the new lows that got made Do we get a break of structure here? No Okay, we come up we make a new low boom Do we get a break of structure here? Yes, this is when I was entering And I was putting my stop loss above these highs Now For targets what was I doing? I was simply just targeting The previous session lows. So again, that's why I was saying if we had New York session lows down here I would have wanted to target that as a second take profit But in this case we don't have New York session lows down there And we just have Asian session lows right here. So what do I do? I enter right here my stop loss are above these highs And we can go ahead and target Asian session lows One to three restore award ratio Plane and freaking simple just like that and this is the strategy That that turn me profitable now. I do want to add a couple more things in here to Enhance this strategy, okay? And I also want to show you guys how we can correlate this to The US indexes, okay? This was our first example and keep in mind This literally happened today. I didn't have to go back and search for Like the perfect trades that I'm like no this literally happened today, bro This isn't no bar replay bullshit. This is this literally happened today, bro So we're going to go to the following day and we're going to see if the same shit happened, okay? So one more time we have again, this is just the following day New York lows New York highs Asian lows Asian highs and this time Neither New York highs or New York lows get hit during Asian sessions So we'll go ahead and lead both those on London session opens We push underneath Asian session lows. We push super far down. We almost take out These New York session lows But what are we going to do since we're pushing down London session fake out? We're monitoring highs. We get a break of structure right here This is looking like another London session loss However, I'm pretty sure you guys can see what's going to happen following this So again Boom like this Targets Asian session high New York high we move Around two percent in profit, which is pretty freaking good But unfortunately we end up getting stopped out so boom now we're at what 5.5% Gained over the past what is it like four trading sessions what happens come to New York session We're going to go ahead and get rid of these Asian session lows because they got taken out. We're going to go ahead and put on London session lows now And put on London session highs And take off these New York lows because they got taken out during the London session What do we see New York session opens when do we push underneath those lows right here When do we get the break of structure right here Raps bro First target London session high bro 1 to 4 risk reward 1 to 4.4 risk reward previous Asian session highs 1 to 5.4 risk reward previous New York session highs 1 to 5.6 3 risk reward Every single one of them got hit So that puts us at around a 10.6 or even more It's like an 11% gain over the past four trading sessions using this freaking simple strategy And actually I'm going to go ahead and end the video here because I don't want to over complicate you guys and over stimulate you guys with US indexes and US equities and and all of this shit if you guys want to know my In-depth US indexes trading strategy and all the confluence that I use because I don't want this video to go too long Watch that super long free course that five and a half hour long video that I'm going to link in the description for you guys So you guys can learn all like my current strategy that uses and plays off of session highs and session lows and break of structure But I add a couple more advanced things in there and then on top of that if you guys want to just like skip over All of the bullshit of jumping from youtube video to youtube video And if you guys just want to learn from me directly I have a mentorship and a teaching program where you guys can learn Literally every single confluence that I use within the market and be able to ask me your personal trading questions So if you guys want access to me myself and other profitable traders to be able to get access to my discord where you guys can Ask literally send in trades just like this and be like hey, what did I do right? What did I do wrong because I know personally My unprofitable self would have benefited very freaking heavily from that while he was trying to figure out the lunch session fake out And I know I can't figure out what's going on and it literally took me months to be able to figure out this strategy on my own versus if I just had my current self here I literally would have been able to fix that within a day and turn profitable pretty much within a freaking day by being able to solve my problem So again with these youtube videos I'm just trying to make a general assumption of the unprofitable trader And I think I do a pretty good job of that and I think I do a good job of showing you guys strategy and showing you guys Confluences and going over the majority of mistakes that unprofitable me would make But I don't know about unprofitable you and only you know your personal trading errors and trading mistakes and trading questions And I don't know how to answer those unless you guys can talk to me directly and talk to other profitable traders directly And that's what I want to give you guys through my mentorship So if you guys want to sign up to that I'll leave another link in the description Or if you guys just want to learn off this free content because trust me my free content is freaking great by all means You don't need my mentorship to turn profitable. It's just going to get you there like a lot faster Just being completely honest by all means just watch the free videos. I appreciate you guys. I'll catch you guys in the next one Peace out

=== VIDEO 34/34 : This_Data-Backed_Strategy_Works_Everyday_Stupid_Simple_And_Proven-[xRuMUvW3T7Q].txt
============================================

This simple data back strategy works every single day. I've tested it over 56 trading days and it has made me seven figures. In this video, I'm going to show you guys the exact strategy and multiple trade examples so that you guys can use it for yourself. But first of all, I want to show you guys the trade Zella dashboard. So you guys know I'm not capping. Again, this is over the course of six months from April 1st to September 30th. We can go through literally every single one of these months, but we can see again, 15 trading days, I was able to make $491,000 in September. I was able to make $247,000 in August with just seven trading days. In July, I actually didn't trade that much. I was in Europe and June, I was able to make $140,000 over the course of 11 trading days. In May, I was able to make $116,000 over the course of 10 trading days. And then last but not least in April, I was able to make $53,000 over the course of seven trading days. So save to say that I know what I'm talking about when it comes to trading and using this specific strategy. And in this video, I want to go over the specific steps that it takes to build the strategy. The specific confluences went to wait for the confluences, went to execute, went to take profit, where to put your stop loss so that you guys can just copy me. So the first thing that we're going to do here is we're just going to lay out the strategy point blank period. We're going to go through every single step. And I'm going to be going in detail and in depth of how we can do this. And then I'm going to show you guys a couple examples. So step one, every single trade that I take is going to be off of a high time frame liquidity sweep. Whether the liquidity sweep happens during pre-market, whether it happens during London session, or whether it happens during New York session, every single trade that I'm taking is going to be consistently off of a liquidity sweep. So the first thing that we're looking to identify is our key levels, which are draws on liquidity and what are draws on liquidity highs and lows within the market. So if we can think about high time frame draws on liquidity, what is that going to be? That's going to be one hour highs and lows, four hour highs and lows, session highs and lows. Okay, we are going to mark these out and then we're going to wait for these highs and lows to get pushed into. And that's going to be the first step of our strategy. We're going to wait for either a one hour high to get swept, a four hour high to get swept, a session high to get swept. And then we're waiting for step two to come after that, which is going to be a reaction showing and proving to us that, hey, this is a liquidity sweep because again, we're not just pressing the buy button and we're not just pressing the sell button. When these key levels get hit, there needs to be other confluence is following that. So that leads us to step number two, which is waiting for some form of confirmation. Okay, so we're going to wait for a five minute confirmation confluence. And what is it confirmation confluence? If you guys are new here, this comes in the form of break of structure. Inverse for value gap, a 79% extension closure and a five minute SMT divergence. So we can go ahead and put every single one of these down here. And again, we don't need every single one of these to happen. We just need one because each one of these confluences signifies the same thing that we swept liquidity step number one. And then step number two is that, hey, this was an actual valid sweep of liquidity. And we are actually changing order flow and we're changing directions. And those orders were actually filled. And the draw on liquidity that we marked out is actually valid. That's how we get that confirmation, right? Because again, like I said, we're not just present by and we're not just present cell, right when we push over a one hour high or underneath a one hour low, that would be stupid and we would lose all of our money. So let me go ahead and write all these down. Or an SMT divergence. Awesome. So number one always has to happen, right? But sometimes, like I mentioned earlier, sometimes number one happens and it happens during pre-market or happens during a previous session. So if number one happens before market open, okay, we need to wait for a five minute manipulation. Okay, so probably saying what does that mean? Well, if we get an hourly sweep and then a change in direction before New York market opens, that's great. Step one and step two have been checked off. But if that happens, we have to wait for a low time frame manipulation on the five minute time frame when New York market opens and you're probably saying, well, why are you doing that? Well, it's an extra safety precaution that I put into the strategy because more often than not, when New York market opens, there's always going to be some form of manipulation. And if we had the high time frame form of manipulation that we were looking for for the strategy during pre-market or during London session, you're probably saying, okay, the manipulation already happened. Well, yes, but also when New York market opens, New Money is coming into the market. And when New Money comes into the market, there's almost always going to be some form of manipulation. So when we get the high time frame manipulation before New York market open, we are still expecting some form of manipulation when New York market opens. So how do we see that through a low time frame manipulation? Because that New Money still needs to manipulate and still needs to activate and take out sweep orders to be able to push price in the direction that it wants to go because New Money is coming into the market. So if number one happens before the market opens like during London session or during pre-market, we wait for a five minute liquidity sweep, okay? And again, we still follow all these rules. So again, let's say we sweep out a four hour low and then we get a five minute break of structure. And that happens during London session. We can see, okay, awesome, price is moving up and then boom, New York market opens, we know our bias is going to want to be bullish because we swept out a low and then we changed direction to the upside. But because that happened before market open, we need to wait and see a five minute manipulation when New York market opens because we know New Money is coming into the market and there has to still be some form of manipulation, okay? When that happens, we can go ahead and rotate to number three. And again, to be is only the case is if number one happens before market opens, okay? Because if number one happens on New York market open, then again, let's think about it. That means New York market opens. There's new money coming into the market and then we sweep out a high time frame, draw on liquidity and then we change direction, awesome. The high time frame draw on liquidity was swept when New York market opens so the manipulation from New York market open has already happened, okay? So there doesn't need to be an extra manipulation because the manipulation that occurred for New York market open was for the high time frame. The only time that we use to be is if the high time frame form of manipulation happens before market opens because again, when New York market opens, there still needs to be some form of manipulation. That moves us to number three. Number three, what are we looking for? We get liquidity sweep, then we get a change in direction, then what are we looking for? So again, I think about this logically when I'm breaking down my strategy, I think, okay, step number one, we need to fill orders. How do we fill orders by taking out liquidity? Number two, we have to confirm that orders have been filled. How do we confirm that orders have been filled with a change in direction, a change in order flow? That's through the confirmation confluence. Number three, what do we need to wait for? Not only do we need to see the orders get filled, not only do we need to confirm that the orders have been filled, but we also need to confirm that the trend is going to continue in our direction. So number three is we wait for a five minute, continued you-ation confluence. And that comes in the form of equilibrium, fair value gaps, or if two B happens, then an SMT divergence. And that's only if two B happens and I'll explain why in a little bit. But again, so let's go through it, top to bottom now. We're looking for an area where orders can be filled. That's going to be above one hour highs, below four, one hour lows, above four hour highs, below four hour lows, above session highs, below session lows. We take out those areas, then what are we looking for? We're looking for confirmation that those orders have been filled. How can we see confirmation by a change in order flow? Then from there, what are we looking for? We're looking for a continuation in the trend to show that hey, orders have been filled. We know that they've been filled because we've changed order flow and we know that this trend is going to continue because we're pushing into the continuation confluence. Once the continuation confluence gets pushed into, then from there, we can scale down to the one minute timeframe and we're looking for a one minute confirmation confluence out of that five minute continuation confluence, via the same exact confirmation confluence that we had had before. So, break of structure, inverse for value gap, 79% extension on the Fibonacci, or an SMT divergence, and then boom, from there, plain as simple, we can enter. Okay, and then last but not least, number six is we target the other draws on liquidity in our direction. So, whatever draws on liquidity, again, let's say we've swept out one hour highs, then we get a five minute break of structure to the downside, then we get five minute equilibrium that gets filled. And then once that equilibrium gets filled, we scale down to the one minute timeframe and then we see a break of structure down out of that, we enter and then we're targeting the other draws on liquidity that are in our direction so that would be one hour lows, four hour lows, session lows, plain and freaking simple. Take a screenshot of this, this is the exact strategy that I use every single day and it works like a fucking shot. Take a screenshot of this, get this done. Now again, we're going to break this down and I'm going to draw it out first and then I'm going to show you guys a couple examples on the charts, okay? So, number one, what are we looking for? One hour highs, four hour highs, session highs, session lows, okay, so let's say we have, boom, a, let's say we have London highs right here, this is market open, and the market comes up, boom, right when market opens, what do we do? We take out a four hour high, boom, step one, check. Then what are we waiting for? We can scale down to the five minute timeframe. We're looking for a five minute confirmation confluence, okay, cool, we get, boom, a five minute break of structure. Check, two B, if number one happens before pre-market, we wait for a five minute liquidity sweep. Nope, this happened during New York market open so we can skip that. Boom, number three, what are we looking for? We see orders had the potential get filled, they got filled because we see the change in direction. Then what are we looking for? We're looking for this trend to continue, so we're looking for a retrace. We can even put on the equilibrium to make it look good. We're looking for price to retrace, either into a fair value app or equilibrium. We come up into equilibrium, once we get into equilibrium, we can scale down to the one minute timeframe. Boom, we scale down to the one minute timeframe, and then let's say we see a break of structure. Out of that, boom, what do we do after that? We enter, and then from there, what are we targeting? The other draws on liquidity in our direction. So let's say we have London lows right here, let's say we have Asian lows down here. Let's see if we have a one hour low right here. Boom, we're entering right here, we're putting our stop loss about these highs, and then we're targeting these lows, bang, bang, bang, symbolize that. So with that being said, put it on the charts. Let's go ahead and go in on, let's see, this day, what is this Tuesday, October 7th? Let's see what price gave us on Tuesday, October 7th. So this market open, let's look at it. We have London Session lows right here, put that in blue, we have previous day highs right here, Asia Session highs right here, London Session highs right here, but those got taken out during pre-market, so we can go ahead and disregard them. We have London Session lows right here, we have previous day lows right here, and boom, those are our draws on liquidity for the day, and then we can also go ahead and mark out these 30 minute lows too. Let's do the same thing on NASDAQ. I truly don't know what's going to happen on this day. This literally just shows this at random, so this could play out or it could not. So we'll see. Okay, same thing, we have previous day highs, we have London lows, we have previous day lows, also these lows down here, these are, I believe hourly lows, I don't even need to mark those out. Boom, 30 minute lows right here. Cool, so let's look at this. So first thing that I'm going to want to do is just be sitting on the five minute timeframe, because again, we already marked out these highs, we don't really need to be sitting on anything else. Okay, mark out these highs, beautiful. So first thing that we do, we come up, and what do you know, we take out previous day highs, okay, that's previous session highs. Boom, we take them out during pre-market, and then from there, what are we looking for? We're looking for a five minute confirmation confluence. Okay, so we come down, but we don't get it. Okay, so we don't get the five minute confirmation confluence and then market opens, okay? So since that's the case, we can say that, okay, we got the one hour or four hour session high that got swept, but we didn't get this. So if that's the case, we're still waiting for number two. Okay, so we're going to sit there, impatiently wait. So we're going to sit on here, and we're watching, and we're waiting, and we're looking for a change in direction. But also, we notice that number one happened before market opens, so we need to wait for a five minute liquidity sweep as well. So again, if we get a sweep of liquidity during pre-market, and then a move down, we're waiting for two things now. We're waiting for a five minute confirmation confluence and we're waiting for a five minute liquidity sweep. Okay, so what do we end up seeing happen? Boom, price comes up, sweeps out this five minute high. Something that I also want to show you guys on the S&P 500. I'm just making a prediction. I'm pretty sure, ah, yes, I was right. We had an SMT divergence right here. So that same five minute high that NASDAQ came up and swept the S&P 500 was not able to sweep. So you're probably saying, well, okay, what does that mean? Well, first and foremost, liquidity sweep during pre-market. So what are we waiting for? We're waiting for confirmation confluence and we're waiting for low time frame sweep of liquidity. So we get the sweep of liquidity on NASDAQ, but we don't get it on the S&P 500. So you're probably saying, well, teacher, what do we do then? Well, let's look at our cheat sheet. Okay, so what does our cheat sheet say? We wait for this, this happened. We are waiting for both of these to happen. Okay, so we're waiting for a five minute confirmation confluence and we're waiting for 2b to happen because this happened during pre-market. Okay, so let's look in here. Five minute confirmation confluence is what are the break of structure inverse for a value gap, 79% extension or an SMT divergence. And we're also waiting for a five minute liquidity sweep. Well, we actually killed two birds one stone with this because what do we end up doing? We end up getting a five minute liquidity sweep, which also ends up making a five minute SMT divergence. We make a higher high here on NASDAQ and 955, pushing above these 935 highs versus on ES. What do we do? We make a lower high boom right here. So we make a bearish SMT divergence while also sweeping out low time frame liquidity. So check on step number one, check on step number two and check on step number two B because we had the sweep during pre-market. What are we looking for next? We're looking for five minute continuation confluence. Now, I'm going to copy this and paste this over to the S&P 500 because we are going to want to prioritize the S&P 500 on this trade. Why? We don't want to be trading on NASDAQ because NASDAQ is the lagging index. NASDAQ is the one that made a higher high on the SMT divergence, which means it's more bullish than the S&P 500. And what are we trying to do right now? We're trying to short the market. We're trying to target lows because we got a liquidity sweep to the upside. So we're going to go over here to the S&P 500 and this is going to be our primary focus for this trading day. So we're going to get in here. Let me go ahead and paste this on. So step number one, check, happened during pre-market. Step number two and two B got hit at the same time because we made an SMT divergence off of that five minute liquidity sweep. Now we're waiting for step number three. So we made the liquidity sweep on that. We got the five minute SMT divergence. Beautiful. From there, what are we waiting for? We wait for a five minute continuation confluence. So at that point in time, boom, we're on this candlestick right here. So what are we waiting for? We're waiting for continuation confluence via equilibrium fair value gap or if 2B happens, then an SMT divergence. OK, so we could look for a potential another SMT divergence. But in this trade case, we hit equilibrium. OK, and let's see if there was a fair value gap. There was a fair value gap that gets filled as well. So both of those confluences end up getting hit. So fair value gap gets filled, equilibrium gets filled. So as we are on our way to fill these confluences, what can we do? We can scale down to the one minute timeframe. OK, so boom, we come up. We're filling the gap and we're filling equilibrium. Awesome. So we're on the one minute timeframe right now. And again, you guys were probably saying when we were writing out the strategy, what do you mean we need to wait for a one minute break of structure to the downside or change of direction? When we're making a five minute retrace and when we're making this five minute move up into this continuation confluence on the one minute timeframe, more often than not, we're going to break structure to the upside. That's not the direction that we're trying to target. But because on the five minute, it's a retrace into equilibrium, into a fair value gap. More often than not, the one minute timeframe is going to change direction to the upside. Why does that happen? Because the one minute in order to make a five minute retrace, it's just going to have to break structure to the upside for the most part. OK, so now that we've broken structure to the upside on the one minute timeframe and we filled the five minute continuation confluence, what are we waiting for? We're waiting for the one minute to change direction back down to the downside for us to enter, right? Because then we've completed everything. We've completed boom liquidity sweep for potential orders to get filled. How do we know that the orders got filled? Boom by SMT divergence. OK, SMT divergence and on top of that, we got the liquidity sweep during pre-market. OK, when that happens, what are we waiting for? We're waiting for some sort of five minute manipulation come market open. We got the five minute manipulation on NASDAQ and we got the SMT divergence from there. What are we waiting for? So that confirmed potential for orders to get filled. We confirmed that orders got filled through the SMT divergence. And then now all we're waiting for is confirmation that the trend is going to continue. And that's the point in time that we're at right now. So we're seeing if price is going to fill this continuation confluence and then continue out of that. So how can we know that price is going to continue out of this? Well, we're just going to sit and watch and wait for these confluence to get filled and then be sitting on the one minute timeframe to see price start rotating back down. So we'll play it and boom, just like that. So we can see right here, we come up into five minute equilibrium and then what is the first confirmation confluence that we get out of that? We get an inverse for Valley gap. Beautiful. We can go ahead and put a short position on there. You can put our stops above these highs right here. And then we can go ahead and target what? The other lows in the opposite direction. OK, because again, one minute confirmation confluence, we waited for an inverse for Valley gap that time. Then what do we do? We enter. We target the other draws on liquidity in our direction. OK, so we have boom, London session lows right here. We have whatever these were previous or sorry, these were London session lows, these were 30 minute lows. And then we have previous day lows all the way down here for a one to seven point three, six risk reward ratio. Let's see what ends up happening here. Boom, take profit one gets hit. We can go ahead and move stop loss to break even take partial profits off at take profit one. Boom, take profit two and three final take profit gets hit for a one to seven risk reward ratio. Just like that following the exact strategy that I just laid out for you guys. And I just chose a random fucking debt just chose a bit random fucking day and just went through the strategy step by step showing you guys exactly how it how it works. Like what else you need to see? What else do you need to see? Literally copy paste this, put this on your fucking put this on your fucking computer, follow this step by step with discipline and consistency. And without a doubt in my fucking mind, as long as you guys are marking out these confluence is correctly, you guys are going to find success in the market. I can't I can't make any promises. I'm not a financial advisor by any means, but this has this has worked for me. Okay, and it's worked for a lot of other people. So cool, let me copy this and let's do it all over again. Let's find another random day. Let's do Friday. Again, I didn't trade on Friday this the 17th. I don't think so we'll see what happens. Let's go ahead and let's mark out our highs and lows. So on the four hour we have four hour lows right here, four hour highs right here, four hour highs right here. On the one hour we have one hour highs right here, one hour highs right here, one hour highs right here, one hour lows right here. And then let's go ahead and mark out our session highs and lows. Boom, these are London lows. These are London highs. We've got another 30 minute high right here. Okay, let's do the same thing here on NASDAQ. I'm just going to speedrun this. We have highs right here, highs right here, four hour highs up here. London and hourly lows down here, another low right here. But let's do it. So first thing that we're going to want to do, let's get into it. Step number one, we're looking for one hour, four hour, session highs, session lows. Okay, so there's lots of things that we have right here. We have these highs right here, but these got taken out during pre-market and there wasn't really any reaction on to that. So we're going to take those off on NASDAQ. Let's see, same situation here, really not much. We have these lows, really not much. We have these London highs right here. Cool. So, and then let me make sure I put on these four hour lows as well. Cool. If we're looking at this, we have a couple options. This is actually a good example of how sometimes your bias can be conflicted, but price action is going to actually show you the right direction that you're going to want to be favoring for the day. Okay, so let's get into this. We're looking for one hour, four hour session highs and session lows. Well, we can see that during London session, we come down and we sweep out these high time frame for our lows and then we get a reversal. Okay, so in the back of our head, we can say, okay, we potentially have a high time frame sweep and a five minute confirmation confluence out of this. So we could be looking for a New York continuation out of this and we could be looking for 2B to happen, right? But, so that's the first thing that's going to be in our minds. The same thing happened on the S&P 500. I can show you it right here. It came down and we swept out. We swept out these four hour lows. Boom, high time frame liquid to be sweep, high time frame, confirmation confluence. We get the five minute break of structure right here and then boom, we end up moving up, right? So that's the first thing that's in our head. But what do we see? Right when market opens, what do we do? We come up and we sweep out, London session highs. So now you're saying, okay, well, we got this and then a change in direction, but then we also got this and then a change in direction right here. So we got a break of structure to the downside. Well, the nice thing about this is we can just see and wait for each one to play out. So let's just sit here and let's look at this real quick. Okay, let's say we have this one in the back of our head, four hours sweep, five minute break of structure. Okay, we could potentially be saying one is checked off, two is checked off, two B were waiting for a potential five minute liquidity suite. But then let's say we get distracted market opens, we sweep out London session highs and then we break structure to the downside. So we say, okay, we swept out London session highs and we got the five minute confirmation confluence. So what are we on? We're on step three and this happened during market open. So we're on step three for shorts. So all you can do is just say, awesome, what are we waiting for for step three? We're waiting for equilibrium or a fair value gap or if two B happens in an SMT divergence, what two B didn't happen, at least for the bearish case. Okay, so we're not able to use a SMT divergence. So if we're bearish because we got the suite in the break of structure, then what can we look for? We can look for equilibrium or a fair value gap and there's no bearish for value gaps here. So we're looking for equilibrium. Awesome. Okay, price comes up into equilibrium. We're looking for shorts, right? This is what TJR strategy said, looking for shorts. Price comes into equilibrium. Okay, we're looking for a break of structure to the downside. Oh wait, it's going higher. Going higher and we close above equilibrium. Oh, so that invalidates step number three. Maybe we should take a look at our steps and see what's going on here. One hour high, check, five minute confirmation confluence. We broke structure to the downside on the five minute right here. Step number three, we're looking for continuation confluence. Okay, let's reevaluate them. Let's go back to what we had to keep in mind before market opened. Four hour sweep, five minute confirmation confluence. The sweep happened before market open. So we need to wait for 2B. If this could potentially be bullish and at this point in time, you're probably thinking, yo, the bearish trade didn't play out and now it's getting late during the day. It's around 950. Trades about to move without me. So you can reevaluate yourself. You say, okay, well step number one got hit, step number two got hit. We need to be, oh, would you look at that? When market open, yes, we did sweep out these highs. But we saw that the bearish bias was invalidated because we closed above these high, but what do we also notice on the five minute timeframe? This is also technically a five minute manipulation of these lows. We see the five minute manipulation of these lows and then we see a break of structure of the upside on the five minute. We get step one over here. We get a five minute confirmation confluence. Step two, 2B is activated because step one happened during pre-market. So we see a market open sweep and then we get a break of structure of the upside. And what? We're looking for number three, five minute continuation confluence. Well, we can look for equilibrium. That gets hit. We can look for a fair value gap. Do we have any fair value gaps? No, we only have equilibrium. Equilibrium gets hit. When equilibrium gets hit, what do we do? We scale down to one minute timeframe and we can sit, watch and wait. We're waiting for one minute reconstruction or one minute inverse for value gap. Okay, the gap that we would need to inverse is all the way up here. Do we inverse it on that first move up? No, we don't. We're looking for this high to get close above. Do we end up closing above it? And we're looking for this high to get close above. Do we close above it? And we're looking for this high to get close above. Do we close above it? Finally, yes. Boom, long. Stopped under here. And then what I actually ended up doing, I actually did. I do remember this day because I took this same exact trade and you guys can fact check it by looking at the trade recap. Oh, I actually took it on NASDAQ. Whoops. Well, whatever. We can target some of these five minute highs on the way up. Unfortunately, on the S&P 500, you would have got stopped out on this. I took the trade on NASDAQ. I didn't get stopped out. But this is a good example of us following our strategy and then, boom, us getting stopped out. And that's something that you guys need to understand. I'm completely, completely fine showing something like this, not only because I took a winning trade on this day and I'm going to show you guys the winning trade on NASDAQ. But also because what our strategies built for us to do, and this is what I want to cover in this video as well, strategies just give us a high probability of predicting where price wants to go. And that's what trading is all about. Trading is about getting into the markets and predicting with high probability where price wants to go every single day. OK, does it mean you're going to have a 100% win rate? No, doesn't mean that there's going to be losses involved. Yes, that's what a high probability means. A high probability means you have a high percentage of winning. But also, there is a chance of losing. On this day, we executed our strategy to a fucking tee and you would have lost on the S&P 500. OK, you would have lost on ES. OK, but if you took the trade on NASDAQ, you would have won. We can go over it super quick, but there you go. So same exact thing. Boom, high time frame sweep, change in direction, market opens. The high time frame sweep happened during pre-market. We need a way for 2B. 2B happens. We get a break structure to the upside. That's why I was looking for a gap because I remember there being a fair value gap on NASDAQ. Boom, we fill in the fair value gap on the one minute time frame. There is an entry within here. We can show it to you. It's the same entry. Boom. Long. Stops. And I actually ended up just taking full take profit right here. And I think it was just because I had to go to the airport. Regardless, 1.39 RISTER award ratio. Again, high probability. Just showed you guys two back-to-back trading days following the exact strategy that has written out going step-by-step exactly. Like literally, you guys just copy it. Copy and paste it. Follow the steps with consistency and discipline. Don't let your emotions get the best of you and just follow that step-by-step. And like, probability will just take you there. Probability will take you there. Bro, you guys will come across videos like this. And you guys will be like, oh my god, this strategy is supposed to be 100% win-ring. OK? And then you guys take a trade using this strategy tomorrow. And then you guys lose. And then you guys are like, well, this fits the fucking scam. Dude, you took one singular trade. That's a small ass sample size. I just showed you my trades at a dashboard over the course of 56 trades. And it's pretty freaking profitable. OK? And that's just 56 trading days. OK? Imagine what happens when we send that even better. So again, I just showed you three examples following it step-by-step. There's two wins, one loss. And it was over the course of two days. And if you took the trade on Nasdaq, then you would have won that day. If you took the trade on ES, then you would have lost on this day. But again, that's part of trading. And that's part of probability that strategies give you. And that's the last thing that I want to talk about in this video is it's something that's taken from Mark Douglas's Trading in the Zone, which is a great book that you guys should for sure go over. And this is something that I'm actually going to be covering super in-depth when it comes to psychology and handling your emotions in my three-day live event. If you guys haven't signed up for this, I highly advise you guys to do it because I'm going to be going way, way, way more in-depth on every single one of my influences, way more trade recaps like this going over my strategy in-depth. You guys are going to be able to ask me questions. We're going to be going over mindset mastery, covering your psychology, how to manage your guys' risk management to maximize your wins, minimize your losses. And all of that's going to be over the course of a three-day live event that I'm doing. I've never done something like this before. I'll leave a link in the description for you guys to sign up to it. Honestly, I've been preparing for this for the past three months now. This is going to be the best content that I've ever put out on trading that I've ever done. It's going to be the most comprehensive. Again, I'm going to be doing it live in front of you guys for multiple hours every single day. So I highly advise you guys to sign up to that. It's happening on November 8th, 9th, and 10th. Okay. Really, really recommend you guys to do that. I'm going to be doing it in the description for you guys to sign up to that three-day live event. This is just like a glimpse of some of the things that I'm going to be covering. Like when it comes to strategy, again, I'm going to be going way, way, way more in-depth. Like the first day, I'll probably be on Zoom with you guys live for around like five to six hours. I know that sounds crazy. I'm going to have to just rip caffeine and be like super dialed in beyond top of it. Maybe you have to go to the bathroom in the middle of it. But I'm telling you guys, it's going to be great. And if you guys want to accelerate your guys' trading and really put yourselves in any position to win going into 2026, that's going to be a great way for you guys to start it. And I wouldn't bullshit you guys. I'm not trying to have you guys going by my freaking course. Okay. This is like literally just a three-day live event. It's going to go over a whole bunch of content for you guys that's going to put you guys into position to win. Now, going back to the psychology portion, this is something that I've taken away from trading in the zone by Mark Douglas. And something that he says is your strategy just gives you a probability against the market. So this is what I was talking about before. All that our strategy does is our strategy a 100% win rate every single day. No, sometimes our strategy doesn't give us trades. And that's actually a drop in the probability bucket for us to stay more probable within these markets because if we follow our strategy step by step, but there's no entry to take or the strategy says like, hey, XXXXXXXX, okay, there's nothing that's popping up for us to be able to get to the point of entering. Then there's no trade for us to take that day. And then awesome, that's going to give us probability. And our strategy says to execute awesome, we execute without hesitation with pure confidence because we know that this strategy gives us high probabilities within the market. And on the flip side, we don't get upset when we take losses. Why? Because we know that losses are a part of the strategy. Well, you're probably saying that doesn't make any sense why our loss is a part of your strategy. Well, because nobody's strategy has a 100% win rate. They're fucking lying to you if they say that. They're completely fucking lying to you if they say that, oh, their strategy has a 100% win rate. Our strategy just gives us a high probability of winning in the markets. We can think of our strategy as a safety net or a safeguard to these highly volatile and these dangerous markets where a lot of people lose money. So what does our strategy do? It actually protects us from the market and it sets us up to only be able to execute when price is moving in our favor. Again, these confluences and this entry strategy that I just covered with you guys in this video, it's more so a way to help you guys save your money in these markets than to maximize and make you guys a shit ton of money. I know that sounds weird, but it's true because if we didn't have a strategy in these markets and we were just pressing by or sell over and over and over again, we would get rinsed. So our strategy is to help us preserve our capital and to help us maximize our capital because it's giving us a high probability of winning. And just because it's a high probability doesn't mean that it's a 100% win rate and that means that losses are involved so that S&P 500 loss that we took and I'm glad that we took it and I'm glad that I could show an example of this so I can cover this concept in this video. So this is required that is part of the strategy losses are required. We go to the trade Zela dashboard you can see that there are losses. My wins are more than my losses. I have a higher probability of winning. I have a higher probability of making more money than losing money, but it still happens. And if you guys can't understand that when it comes to strategy, then you guys are forever going to suffer in these markets because you guys are forever going to be looking and seeking for something that doesn't exist. You guys are forever going to be looking for some sort of 100% win rate strategy. You're going to move on to another strategy because you think, oh, this strategy doesn't work because I lost a couple trades. That's what it's about. Okay. Strategies just help us have a higher odds in this dangerous market. So if you can't handle a loss, then trading is not for you. Okay. And that's that's the thing that I want to leave you guys with. Hopefully you guys appreciated this video. If you guys haven't already signed up to the three day life event, I'm going to go super in depth on all of these confluences, strategy mindset mastery. Again, if you guys haven't learned about trading psychology, this, that, like that little last piece was like just the tiniest glimpse of some of the things that I'm going to be going into the psychology class is going to take the entire day. It's going to be around three or four hours. I've been preparing for this forever. So I really want you guys to appreciate it as much as I think it's going to benefit you guys. So if you guys haven't already signed up to that, I love and appreciate you guys. Drop us up if you haven't already. Peace out.
